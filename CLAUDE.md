## Handoffs are data — commit and push in place

`docs/handoffs/` is session-handoff memory (Tier 2 deep-recovery
documents), not code — an append-only log, one file per handoff, never
rewritten. Per the operator's explicit instruction (2026-08-15), this repo
has a push-in-place exception for that directory, matching the pattern
used elsewhere in the ops-djbclark suite (e.g. `site-private/memory/`):

- Commit handoff files directly to `master`, in place — no branch, no PR,
  no worktree required.
- Push immediately after committing. Don't leave it local awaiting a
  separate "ok to push" prompt.
- This exception is narrow: `docs/handoffs/` only. Ordinary code/doc
  changes in this repo still go through normal review as the operator
  directs in the moment — this file doesn't blanket-authorize pushing
  arbitrary work.

## Graft — repo context graph

This repo is indexed in `graft/`: small linked markdown nodes that explain each
system and carry exact file:line spans, kept in sync with the code through git.

For ANY task here — understanding how something works, finding where code lives,
or scoping a change — get context from the graph before grepping or opening
source files. Re-ask freely (it's cheap) and reuse literal identifiers you
already have (symbol, error string, file name) as the query. New to this repo?
Run `graft map` first — a token-budgeted orientation (dir clusters, hubs,
hotspots), no LLM, no key.

- Run `graft ask "<your question>" --source` → ranked nodes with the relevant
  code spans inlined (each hit's ≤8-line crux by default; `--full` for whole
  definitions when the crux isn't enough). Match the tool to the task shape:
  for understanding or editing, the top node IS the answer — cite its
  `covers:` file:line spans and edit straight from `--source`. For
  exhaustive tasks ("every occurrence / every caller of this pattern"), ranked
  results are top-N, not complete — run `graft grep "<literal>"` instead
  (exhaustive over indexed files, grouped by enclosing symbol), falling back
  to raw `grep -rn` only for unindexed files.
- `graft skeleton <file>` → every definition's signature + span, ~10× cheaper
  than reading the file; use it to skim an API surface.
- `graft callers <symbol>` gives precomputed, exact edges — who calls this.
  Add `--direction out` for what it calls, or `--depth N` to walk
  transitively for the full blast radius. For structural questions, skip
  ranking and use this directly.
- Or browse: `graft/INDEX.md` lists every node; follow the links.
- Monorepos and folders of multiple repos rank fairly across sub-projects —
  hits carry `[scope/]` labels naming which one they're from. Narrow with
  `graft ask "<task>" --in <scope>/` once you know where you're working.

If a returned span is truncated ("+N more lines"), open the file at that exact
range before finalizing. Only open source files when a node genuinely lacks a
needed detail, and then at the exact file:line the node points to — never
re-read whole files.

After big code changes, refresh the graph with `graft build` (deterministic,
no API key, $0).

## CFEngine reference book — query it, don't guess (2026-10-03)

`Learning CFEngine` (Diego Zamboni, 2nd ed.; covers CFEngine 3.12) is in the
local book knowledge base as slug `learning-cfengine` — 69 chapters, 210 code
blocks. **Before writing or reviewing CFEngine policy** — promise semantics,
`edit_line`, bundle/body syntax, class expressions, normal ordering, testing —
query it rather than relying on recall:

- `~/ops/site-private/bin/book-kb query '<regex>' learning-cfengine` — exact
  match, ~0.5–5k tokens. **This is what proves a term is or is not in the book.**
- `~/ops/site-private/bin/book-kb toc learning-cfengine` — ~2.5k-token chapter
  index; then read one chapter (~1.2k median). Add `--deep` for `file:line`
  anchors to every sub-heading.
- basic-memory `search_notes(project="books", query=…)` — semantic recall when
  you don't know the author's wording. Ranked by similarity, so a hit is **not**
  a match; confirm with the exact query above.

Never read `~/kb/raw/learning-cfengine.md`: that is the entire book, ~115k
tokens. The index exists so you don't have to. Full detail, including how to add
a book: `site-private/AGENTS.md` ("Book knowledge base").
