# How tendcf works

**Vetted current-state description.** Same architecture as the technical
paper, in plainer language. This version describes the system as it is
designed today, and what is planned next. It does not recount how the
design was reached.

Where any other living document disagrees on the **current design**,
**this guide wins** — with one exception. Where the implementer map fixes
a *security parameter* that this guide states only in general terms — the
offline root's 2-of-3 threshold, NAR digests in the manifest — the map's
value is a **floor**. This guide's silence is not permission to relax it.
Archival files (dated notes, briefs, handoffs, deprecated drafts, paper
reviews) are snapshots; do not rewrite them to match — they lose on
conflict.

Draft, circulated for comment. Not submitted for publication.
Daniel Joseph Barnhart Clark (djbclark@mit.edu).
Prepared 2026-08-14; re-checked against the repository 2026-08-18.

The implementer map (decisions, build order, protection rules) is
[`architecture-DEFINITIVE-v3.md`](../architecture/architecture-DEFINITIVE-v3.md)
and must agree with this guide. The technical paper, with citations and
open questions in research form, is
[`tendcf-architecture-paper.md`](tendcf-architecture-paper.md).

**Nothing described here is deployed.** The data formats exist and are
checked, a first generic policy bundle runs, and the projection step has a
reference implementation. The compiler, the on-device executor, and the
screens a person would use to accept or refuse a change are still to be
built. No device has been set up from factory reset by this automation.

One thing that *was* built, and was not planned: §19 describes the defects
found underneath, in CFEngine itself, by leaning on the parts of it this
design depends on.

A previous configuration stack on this fleet is **legacy reference only**.
It is not a dependency, not an upstream, and not copied into this project.
Patterns taken from it are described in generic terms.

## 1. What this is

`tendcf` is a design for keeping a mixed set of computers in an agreed
state: Apple Silicon Macs, Linux machines (Intel and ARM), and Android
devices reached through [Termux](https://termux.dev/). The computers are
often offline. More than one trusted person can act. There is no dedicated
operations staff, and no always-on central server that every device must
reach.

Most of the configuration will be written by AI coding agents, not typed by
a person. People still decide what should happen. A person whose computer is
managed should be able to read a proposed change in ordinary language and
refuse it — using **their** AI, not ours.

Two other goals sit alongside that:

- The generic machinery is publishable. Someone else should be able to
  supply their own facts and run the same code.
- The installed OS on a new Linux box is an ordinary distribution, not
  [NixOS](https://nixos.org/). Nix is used for builds and (later) as an
  optional way to *write* site data. It is not the thing a stranger has to
  install as their operating system.

---

## 2. The picture

```
  tendcf                 engine: schemas/types, generic adapters,
  (public)               default advisor prompt, compiler interface

  site-shared            reusable recipes (a Caddy role, an apt pattern).
  (optional, public)     Not live inventory.

  foreign site-shared    other people's recipes, listed as inputs.
  (read-only)

  site-private           this site's facts: inventory, allocations,
  (never an input)       secret names, trust policy, extra advisor prompt.
                         Holds the lockfile that pins everything else.

  tool forks (optional)  nix2cf, sudo-secretspec, Shizuku, … only if
                         patching them.

          │  Site Model instances (private) + recipes (shared)
          ▼
  nix2cf                 compiler: merge → conflict check → infer
  (tool)                 ordering → CFEngine Augments JSON.
                         Not the home of schemas or facts.

          ▼
  Signed release         manifest + per-host canonical goal file
                         (TUF-subset; the device validates the diff
                         from its own approved baseline)

          ▼
  CFEngine +             each device is its own policy hub.
  tendcf-agent           Supervisors are adapters: systemd, launchd,
                         runit, Jobber, … from one service record.

          ▼
  JSONL log (capture)    append-only; the durable record
  SQLite (index)         tendcf-agent; rebuildable from JSONL
```

Git-repo count is not the composition mechanism. Layers are roles.
Site-private holds a lockfile (flake-style inputs) that pins tendcf,
nix2cf, site-shared, foreign shared sites, and optional tool forks. The
signed release is the deploy artifact. There is no lockstep of sibling
checkouts that must share one tag.

Collision of the same identity from two peer inputs is a **compile error**.
Only site-private may bind a winner (`caddy: from: alice`) or a short name.
Never silent last-wins.

Six ideas in this picture come from [Bcfg2](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/lisa05/tech/full_papers/desai/desai.pdf),
a configuration system built at Argonne and described in a series of papers
by Narayan Desai and colleagues — extra entries (§11), Actions as
bundle-scoped guards and the bundle as the re-verification scope (§12),
`buildfile` (§4), revision stamping (§6), and `altsrc` (§13). They are
credited in the sections that use them. [CFEngine](https://docs.cfengine.com) is the on-device engine; `tendcf`
does not replace it.

---

## 3. Facts live in layers

Every fact about *this* site lives in checked YAML/JSON files called the
**Site Model**. Behavior lives in generic code in tendcf that holds none of
those facts. Adapters translate. CFEngine, the toolchain bootstrapper, and
Nix-for-builds are *consumers*. Any one of them can be replaced without
moving the facts.

**Schemas and types live in tendcf**, not in the compiler. A schema change
is an interface change. A hostname change is site data. They do not move
together. The files are [`schema/`](../../schema/) and
[`examples/`](../../examples/) in this repository.

**Inventory is private by default.** Site-shared may ship device *kinds*,
example inventories, and **explicit exports** (public endpoints, role
advertisements) for fields the private site marked exportable. USB serials,
RFC1918 addresses, and the full host list stay private. Two foreign sites
both shipping a host named `mac` is a compile error unless private binds.

A host identity in trust and ChangePlans is the **device public key**, not
the hostname.

Foreign inputs are namespaced (`alice.caddy`) so auto-provided service
tokens do not collide. Private may alias a short name.

Three record types do most of the work.

**Services.** One record per service: name, run-as user, command,
environment as *names* of secrets (never the secret values), which role it
binds to, who owns it, which supervisor that host uses. Every systemd unit,
launchd plist, runit service, or Jobber job in the fleet is meant to be a
rendering of one such record.

**Roles.** A feature role maps to `{main, backups[], peers[]}`. “The control
node” is not a machine. It is a row in this file. Any eligible host can
hold any role.

**Unit writers.** Exactly one writer per unit-name prefix, for every
supervisor (launchd label, systemd instance, runit service, Jobber job).
Two tools writing the same unit is a class of outage this file is meant to
make impossible. launchd is one adapter, not the model.

The Site Model may later be *authored* in the Nix module system
(`mkOption`, `mkIf`, `mkDefault`) and rendered to the same JSON everything
else consumes. That is an authoring frontend only. Nobody adopting the
project has to know Nix. Until that frontend exists, the files are written
as YAML.

Every schema is paired with a concrete example file, except schemas that
hold only shared definitions and describe no document of their own; those
are named in an explicit allowlist. The lint derives the pairing from the
filesystem, so it fails if a schema arrives without its example, if an
example arrives without its schema, or if a new schema is added to
neither list. A lookup
command is planned so an agent can ask “who provides port 443?” without
reading the whole registry.

---

## 4. A compiler turns facts into CFEngine data

The compiler (working name `nix2cf`) reads the Site Model and writes
[CFEngine Augments](https://docs.cfengine.com/docs/3.21/reference-language-concepts-augments.html)
— JSON files (`def.json`, `host_specific.json`) CFEngine reads natively as
a data-injection layer. The version history is on that page: 3.7.0 put
augments into the Masterfiles Policy Framework and 3.7.3 back-ported
`def.json` parsing into the core agent, but `$(sys.workdir)/data/host_specific.json`
has only been parsed **since 3.18.0**. Using both files therefore sets the
floor at CFEngine 3.18, not 3.7. The name is historical, and despite it
**YAML is not a valid Augments input** — CFEngine 3.27.1 reads JSON only.
YAML remains an authoring format for the Site Model (§7) and never reaches
the agent. The compiler is a tool, not the home of schemas.

**The two files are not read by the same code, and they do not land in the
same place.** `def.json` goes through the augments loader and its keys
become `def.<key>`. `host_specific.json` goes through CFEngine's CMDB
loader, where an unprefixed key defaults to namespace `data`, scope
`variables` — so policy reads it as `$(data:variables.<key>)`. The first
draft of the generic bundle below assumed the augments scope for both. It
was wrong, and it failed *silently*: the variables simply did not exist and
nothing said so. That is the kind of thing this project now confirms
against a running agent rather than reading off a documentation page, and
§19 is what happened when that habit was applied more widely.

CFEngine’s [Masterfiles Policy Framework](https://github.com/cfengine/masterfiles)
is already largely data-driven on top of that layer. For the common case
the compiler therefore emits *data*, not CFEngine source text. A generic
bundle written once handles “this package is present and pinned, these
directories exist, this service is loaded” for any entry in the data.

A first version of that bundle exists and runs:
[`policy/tendcf_services.cf`](../../policy/tendcf_services.cf). It handles
launchd only — systemd, runit and Jobber are unwritten — so “supervisors
are adapters” (§5) is still a claim about a design, not about running code.
§16.C shows it working, including an interlock that genuinely refuses.

The pipeline has four stages:

1. **Merge** site, role, and host layers into one picture per device.
2. **Conflict check** over that already-merged picture. Two writers claiming
   the same port or path is a build failure, not last-wins. The error names
   the resource, every writer that declared it and where, the conflicting
   values, and what a resolution would look like.
3. **Dependency inference** — see §9.
4. **Render** the Augments JSON.

Merge happens once, in the compiler, before render. CFEngine’s own
`mergedata()` is not used for this.

Because the render is a pure function of the Site Model — same input, same
output — “show me exactly what device X would receive, without touching
device X” is almost free. That command is planned as the first piece of
the compiler. It is how an agent checks its own work, how the compiler
regression-tests itself, and how a human sees a proposed change before it
lands. The shape is [Bcfg2 `buildfile`](https://docs.bcfg2.org/).

Compiling a typed description into an existing engine’s native format is a
known pattern. [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) does it into systemd units;
[nix-darwin](https://github.com/nix-darwin/nix-darwin) does it into
launchd agents; [cdk8s](https://cdk8s.io/) does it into Kubernetes YAML.
The pairing here is Site Model into CFEngine Augments, because of
[Promise Theory](https://markburgess.org/promises.html) and disconnected
multi-owner operation — not because the compiler mechanism is new.

**Where it runs:** operator machine or CI. Consented devices receive a
signed artifact. They do not run Nix or nix2cf.

---

## 5. Every device runs its own agent

Each computer runs CFEngine, including its own `cf-serverd`, and reads
policy that arrived as part of the ordinary signed-release path, synced
via git. There is no dedicated central policy host, no SSH requirement,
and no requirement to push.

Push still exists: a host that currently holds a deploy role can trigger
an immediate run on **operator** (and operator-chosen `managed`) hosts.
Push to a `consented` device still requires that device’s consent grant.
Push and pull are two modes of the same mechanism.

CFEngine’s usual textbook deployment is hub-and-spoke: one policy server,
clients pulling from it. The shape here is different and still supported:
a host may bootstrap as its own policy hub when its declared server
address is itself. Applied fleet-wide, off a shared git-synced source,
that is closer to [GitOps / Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) (an in-place agent
pulling desired state from git, no reachable control plane holding
credentials) than to CFEngine’s brochure diagram.

The “no control node” property is CFEngine’s own (Promise Theory: each
machine is an independent agent that keeps its own promises). What this
design adds is the fleet-wide self-hub plus git-synced source, the Site
Model that says who currently holds which role, and the consent gate.

**Supervisors are adapters.** A service record is one fact. The host’s
`supervisor` field (or a platform default) selects the renderer:
[systemd](https://systemd.io/), launchd (macOS example),
[runit](http://smarden.org/runit/) via [termux-services](https://github.com/termux/termux-services),
[Jobber](https://dshearer.github.io/jobber/), OpenRC / s6 / dinit when a
real host needs one. Packages on Linux come from CFEngine’s package
modules. File and service idioms are taken from
[ncf / Rudder generic methods](https://github.com/Normation/ncf) as a
vendored, stripped reference — not as a runtime.

---

## 6. Each device keeps its own record

Capture and index are different files.

1. **Capture:** append-only JSONL. One `write()`. If logging fails, a line
   is lost, not the history. [CFEngine Enterprise](https://docs.cfengine.com)
   already does this locally (`promise_log.jsonl`) before a hub copies it
   into SQL. Community needs the same glue.
2. **Index:** SQLite inside **tendcf-agent**, for queries, extra-entry
   counts, “what release am I on.” Rebuildable from JSONL. If the database
   is corrupt, history still exists.

CFEngine never opens SQLite. The agent tails (or receives) the log.

Two operational reasons the *device* is the record of truth:

- On CFEngine Community the local capture has to be built anyway, so
  local-as-record is the default and central-as-record is a second system.
- Devices in this fleet do go unreachable. A central copy fed by
  best-effort sync is incomplete during exactly the windows one would want
  it.

**Android:** Termux (`com.termux`) and tendcf-agent are different UIDs. The
APK cannot read `$PREFIX/...` as files.
[RUN_COMMAND](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/RUN_COMMAND-Intent)
is a user-granted bridge, not a shared log directory. tendcf-agent owns
**both** JSONL and SQLite in **app-private storage**. Either cf-agent runs
as a native helper of the agent (same UID), or a Termux-side reporter
*pushes* lines to the agent. Never “the agent opens Termux’s files.”

The outcome words are borrowed from Rudder’s `ncf` library, used here as a
reference vocabulary rather than as a runtime dependency:
`success` / `repaired` / `error` / `n-a` in enforce mode,
`compliant` / `noncompliant` / `error` / `n-a` in audit mode.

A path to a fleet-wide view already exists and costs nothing new to stand
up: a subset of each device’s index can push, best-effort, into an
observability stack (Vector / OpenObserve / Grafana). That view is never
the record of truth. When a question such as “did the security rollout land
everywhere?” needs a real yes or no, reachable devices are queried
directly and the rest are treated as unknown, not as a stale aggregate.

Every report row carries the release that produced it. Each device records
which release it is converged to.

---

## 7. Changes arrive as signed plans

Configuration reaches devices only as a versioned, signed release. What a
release carries for each host is that host’s **goal file**: one JSON
document describing the device’s complete intended state — every service,
package, file, and domain the site claims to manage — fully resolved, with
nothing left to a default.

A **ChangePlan** is the difference between two goal files: the one the
device is currently converged to and the one the release proposes. The
device computes that difference itself, from its own stored, approved copy,
so a device seven releases behind is briefed on the one true delta from
where it actually is rather than on a delta from a baseline it never
reached. The compiler computes the same diff at release time, as a preview
for whoever is proposing the change and as a regression test for the
compiler. Where the baselines agree the two must agree, and a disagreement
is reported, not swallowed.

The diff is structural, not textual: entries added, removed, or replaced,
addressed by `(domain, kind, id)`, each carrying the whole old and new
entry. A text rendering of it is a display convenience and is never what
gets signed.

The on-device **validator** therefore compares; it does not interpret. It
checks that the received goal file is byte-identical to its own canonical
form of that file, that the difference from its stored baseline is exactly
the difference that was approved, and — where the device’s tier requires a
local yes (§14) — that the approval is signed by the enrolled advisor key,
bound to this device’s public key, to both document hashes, and to a nonce
this device issued. Then it lets CFEngine converge on the new state — by
way of a device-side **projection**, not by reading the goal file directly.
CFEngine’s Augments layer never sees the goal file; a policy-free
projection step, run only after approval, re-keys the approved state into
the narrow `{"vars": {…}}` shape Augments actually consumes (§16.A). The
goal file is the object consent binds to; the projection is derived from
it, not signed itself, and is not the whole document.
Nothing in that path has to decide what an operation *means*, because there
are no operations: there are two states and an approved difference between
them.

**One meaning, one file.** Serialization noise would be camouflage. If the
same state can be written two ways, a change can hide in the difference
between the two. So the goal file has a canonical form — JSON on the wire,
collections sorted by a declared key, every field present with an explicit
value, no empty collections, no timestamps or nonces inside the document —
and a file that is not already in that form is refused rather than
normalized. YAML stays an authoring format for the Site Model and never
reaches a device.

**Removals are actuated, not omitted — and a removal is a state, not an
event.** Under a convergent engine the absence of a promise is the absence
of enforcement, not reversal: drop an entry and the thing keeps running. So
a removed entry does not leave the goal file; it stays, marked absent, as a
**tombstone**, and the explicit negative promise — the file deleted, the
package absent, `service_policy => "stop"` — renders from the **file**, not
from the diff. That is what makes it idempotent: a crash mid-apply, a
re-run, or a device catching up across several releases at once all converge
to the same place, where a one-shot instruction carried only in a transient
diff would simply be lost. A briefing renders a removal as what it will do,
never as a blank space.

**Silence means two different things, and the file says which.** In a domain
the goal file declares comprehensive (§11), an entry that does not appear in
the diff is unchanged. In a domain still marked `not-yet-migrated`, it is
merely undescribed. The per-domain coverage declarations travel inside the
goal file so that the validator and the briefing can keep those apart.

**Unknown means refuse.** The goal file carries a schema version. A
validator that meets a version above its ceiling, or an entry kind it does
not recognize, refuses the whole file and keeps converging on the last state
it approved — a visible, reportable stall, not a brick. Ignoring the
unrecognized part instead would let an unreviewed change ride in on a
reviewed diff. Devices are not stranded by that rule, because goal files are
per-host: the compiler renders each host at the highest schema version that
host last reported it can read (§6 is where that report comes from), and a
schema change ships as two releases — the validator update first, as an
ordinary diff, and the migration behind it.

**Accept is all or nothing.** A refusal may name the entries that caused it;
it never applies the remainder. The proposer withdraws the corresponding
source changes, re-renders the complete goal file, re-runs the conflict
check (§4), and offers a new diff. No device applies a state the compiler
never rendered and never checked.

**Two events produce a total diff**, and both are their own consent class
rather than an ordinary review. The first is the goal file a device accepts
at first run, bounded by what it may claim: it manages only the domains
named aloud at that ceremony, and everything else enters as
`not-yet-migrated` — which turns one unreviewable everything-diff into a
sequence of ordinary ones, counted by the same backlog §11 already counts.
The second is a schema migration, which is valid only if it changes nothing:
migrating the old file and diffing it against the new one must come out
empty apart from the version bump. Migration and meaning never move in the
same release.

**Some regions of the file are privileged.** Trust policy, advisor keys, the
peer allowlist, the digest of the policy tree, the validator’s own version,
and the schema version itself are a short, enumerable list of paths — and a
diff that touches one of them needs a ceremony to match, not an ordinary
accept. The list is the validator’s and lives on the device, because a
privilege flag a proposer can set is a privilege flag a proposer can clear.

**Anything fetched is named by its bytes, not by its name.** Where an entry
points at content the device has to go and get, the goal file carries that
content’s digest, the digest is part of what the person accepted, and the
device re-checks it immediately before applying. A name can be repointed
after approval; a digest cannot. This is the general rule; the specific
inventory for the build cache is a later step (see the implementer map),
and until it exists the rule binds the fetches the design already makes.

**The stored baseline is the root of the gate.** Every diff is computed
against the device’s copy of the currently-approved goal file, and every
approval binds to it, so that document needs integrity-protected storage and
is verified before anything else is. Corrupt or swap it and the device
either refuses everything or — worse — presents a first-adoption-shaped
total diff and launders an arbitrary state through the ceremony meant for
day one.

What the validator bounds is the state that is *described*, not every effect
of reaching it. A package that installs runs its vendor’s scripts as root,
and no comparison of two JSON documents refuses that. §17 says where that
becomes the binding limit.

Signing is a small subset of [The Update Framework](https://theupdateframework.io/),
sized for one operator: an offline root with a 2-of-3 signing threshold,
release signatures, a snapshot that binds the metadata set together, and
an emergency role. Each client
that applies a signed artifact keeps a high-water mark so replay, freeze,
and downgrade are rejected.

**First-run root.** The [TUF spec](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/)
assumes a good trusted `root.json` shipped with the updater, out of band.
TOFU (trust on first use) is not used for consented devices. Install shows
the root key IDs / fingerprint; the person compares that to a channel they
already trust (operator, printed card, published fingerprint). Later root
rotation is in-band (threshold of old **and** new keys). Threshold
compromise of root is again out of band.

**Emergency vs consent.** Revocation, “do not apply releases signed by K,”
freeze detection, and high-water rejection **tighten** what may run. They
do not need a local yes. Installing new targets still does, on
`consented` devices. An optional enrolled policy “I pre-grant emergency
security patches from role E” may exist; **default off**.

On top of the verifiable diff sits a *semantic* layer — generated, cached,
written for a language model to read: “this bumps a TLS library across a
CVE and restarts the public proxy.” That layer briefs a person and their
advisor. **It never authorizes.** Where the prose can be filled in from the
entries the diff carries, it is. Where it has to be written freely, it must
point at the exact fields it is summarizing.

Provenance belongs to that layer too. “Which source change produced this
entry?” is answered on demand — re-render with the candidate change
reverted, diff the renders, subtract — rather than asserted as a field
inside the signed artifact, because a provenance claim carried in the
artifact is one the device cannot check. For the same reason the diff format
carries no grouping and no privilege flags: grouping may inform the display,
and privilege is derived by the validator from a list it holds locally, but
neither is something a proposer gets to assert.

CFEngine’s own `cf-agent --simulate` can additionally show a person what a
run would change on this device right now. It covers files and packages, not
whether a service ends up loaded and running, so it confirms a diff rather
than establishing one — which is also why it is not a substitute for the
comparison above. Making it usable for that confirmation is the origin of
two of the upstream contributions in §19: `--simulate-json`, so the change
set is machine-readable rather than prose, and an option to keep the
simulation chroot afterwards so it can be inspected. Both are offered and
neither has merged, so today this remains a manual check.

---

## 8. The person’s own AI

We never run their model, see their prompt, or see the conversation. We
offer a change and accept a signed yes/no. Same shape as a
[Kubernetes admission webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/).

- At install they enroll an **advisor key** (or a local app/socket) in
  site-private.
- tendcf ships a **suggested default prompt** as a replaceable public file.
  They may append or replace it.
- Modes: auto-review, or a conversation with them first.
- Return path: `accept | reject`, signed by the enrolled key, bound to both
  goal-file hashes and to the nonce the device issued (§7). A `reject` may
  name the entries that drove it. Timeout is deny. Advisor down → fail
  closed for *installs* (revocation still applies, §7).
- Custom tools (OpenPGP web of trust, a transparency log, a chain, gossip
  of signed apply-attestations) are theirs. Consensus among “everyone
  waiting for everyone else” is a separate project that consumes
  attestations. tendcf owes: the ChangePlan, optional exportable
  apply-attestations, the `accept | reject` slot.

The proposing side and the consenting side are different programs. The
advisor never authorizes; the executor does, against the signed grant.

Personal branch: theirs, applied under their consent; never auto-merges
into anyone else’s trust domain. Upstream-heal is a suggestion their agent
evaluates.

None of this surface is built yet (§18).

---

## 9. The writing rule

Most of this system’s configuration will be written by AI agents. An
agent sees the file in front of it, not the invariants living in twelve
other files it never opened. From that, two working rules:

> **Prefer designs that require only local knowledge over designs that
> require global knowledge.** If correctness follows from information
> present at the point of authorship, an agent can satisfy it. If
> correctness depends on already knowing what everyone else declared, an
> agent will violate it *confidently and plausibly* — which is worse than
> violating it obviously.

> **Prefer machine-checkable to conventional.** A convention an agent must
> remember is a convention it will eventually break silently. A schema, a
> type, or a compile-time check catches it and reports it in a form the
> next agent can act on. If a comment says “remember to…”, that text
> belongs in a schema instead.

For a human maintainer, “just write down the constraint you know about”
is cheap and explicit. For an agent with a bounded context, that is
exactly the expensive thing. The agent’s problem is not willingness to
write the constraint. It is knowledge that the constraint exists.

The same pattern shows up outside this project. Programming-language
research has long asked how local reasoning can guarantee a global
property. Recent writing on AI-generated code makes the same move: models
are reliably better at local (function-level) reasoning than at global
reasoning, so a language that lets a local author discharge a global
property helps generated code the same way it helps verified code.
Empirical work on language models using long contexts shows accuracy
drops when the relevant fact sits in the middle of the window. Benchmarks
of AI-generated infrastructure-as-code find that first-try correctness on
real cloud scenarios is low, and that a distinct, substantial error
category is *contextual reasoning failure* — missing or wrong
cross-resource references. Schema and syntax errors, the category
ordinary validation is best at, are the smallest slice.

Those findings are why the Site Model asks each record to state what it
provides and what it needs (§10), why conflict errors carry a resolution,
why “show me device X” is first in the compiler, and why generated
explanations must point at the plan they summarize.

The rule is a working hypothesis, not a law. §20 asks what would count
against it.

## 10. Ordering without a shared to-do list

Services have to start in a workable order. There are three levels of
ambition:

- **Retry until stable.** Keep applying until the number of unfinished
  jobs stops shrinking. CFEngine already does this. No author has to know
  anything about ordering.
- **Plus explicit `depends_on`**, written by someone who already knows
  that someone else’s resource exists and must run first.
- **Plus inference.** Each type states only what it *provides* and what it
  *requires*. The compiler derives ordering edges from those matches.

This design uses all three. Retry-until-stable is the substrate. Explicit
`depends_on` remains available and wins where it exists. The primary
authoring mechanism is `provides` / `requires`, because each is answerable
from inside one file by an author that has never seen the rest of the
system.

A service named `caddy` **auto-provides** `service:caddy` unless it opts
out. Explicit `depends_on` still wins. See §15 for how an author finds
the name.

Three compiler rules follow:

- **Types first, inference second.** Inference does not start until real
  type definitions exist on two platforms.
- **Every edge carries its origin.** Authored (with source location) or
  inferred (with the rule that produced it). A bad inferred edge presents
  as “why is this waiting?” Origin information turns that from a search
  into a lookup.
- **Authored edges win.** If an authored edge and an inferred edge cover
  the same pair, the authored one is kept and the coincidence is
  *reported*, not silently collapsed.

Bcfg2 deliberately built no dependency graph. Its client repeats while
pending work decreases. That is simpler, and it has two decades of
production behind it. The extra machinery here is justified only if the
writing rule in §9 is right. Three ways it may not be:

1. Retry-until-stable may already *be* the local-knowledge answer — more
   local than `provides` / `requires`, not less.
2. `provides` / `requires` may only relocate the global knowledge. Naming
   a token that another type must name identically is a shared vocabulary.
   Auto-provide plus a lookup CLI (§15) is the mitigation. It is untested
   in use.
3. Spurious edges may be worse than priced in. Origin information is
   supposed to make them a query. That claim is untested.

This design does **not** compile everything into one fully ordered
Puppet-style catalog. The service-owning roles examined so far declare no
role-to-role dependencies and run as independent plays. Catalog
compilation earns its keep when chains interleave into a genuine web of
prerequisites. These, so far, do not.

That reading is of automation that already runs on provisioned devices. It
is not a reading of a cold device. Convergent automation leaves no trace
of a constraint that fails on run 1 and succeeds on run 2, and **no device
in this fleet has been provisioned from factory reset by this
automation.** The cold path is untested.

## 11. Extra entries: noticing what shouldn’t be there

Bcfg2’s configuration goals are comprehensive: the specification describes
every configuration entity on the client, so anything present on the
client and absent from the specification is unintended, and is reported as
an **extra entry**. The client verifies in both directions — no less than
specified, and no more.

This design adopts that **per domain**, not per client on day one.
Domains are slices such as “the app list on this device,” `/etc/ssh`, or
“services under this unit prefix.” Fleet-wide comprehensiveness on a
machine that was never built under it is not survivable.

A domain is comprehensive unless it opts out, and opting out requires a
reason from a closed set of two:

- **`not-yet-migrated`** — real device state nobody has described yet.
  Normal on day one. A backlog item, and countable. That count *is* the
  remaining work.
- **`deliberately-unmanaged`** — state that is genuinely not ours to
  describe: user data, another tool’s territory, device-generated caches.
  Permanent, and should be rare.

A bare on/off flag would let an agent widen the unmanaged surface
silently. The reason string makes every gap a visible, searchable
decision.

Keeping the two reasons distinct is what makes default-on livable. Bcfg2’s
booklet records a first client run of `Total managed entries: 0 /
Unmanaged entries: 2308`. The deployment story there is grinding the
second number down. The first transcription pass here is expected to look
the same.

This is also the only mechanism in the design that notices two writers
changing the same device without coordinating. CFEngine’s default posture
— promising only about what is mentioned — cannot detect that, by
construction.

---

## 12. Interlocks: “don’t do this until…”

Some constraints are not ordering. They are *preconditions*.

Setting always-on VPN lockdown on a device whose VPN is unauthenticated
severs every management path to that device. That is not “start B after
A.” It is “do not do B unless this probe still succeeds.”

[Bcfg2 Actions](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/lisa06/tech/full_papers/desai/desai.pdf)
are the shipped precedent: unless exit status is ignored, a failing
pre-action prevents modification of entries in the enclosing bundle. That
is a guard with a defined blast radius — not an edge in a graph, and not
a bare `if`.

This design makes that a first-class Site Model field. It compiles to a
CFEngine guard class plus a bundle-scoped refusal. The bundle is both the
grouping unit and the re-verification scope, also following Bcfg2.

Blast radius and reporting are required constants in the schema, not
author-settable fields. An author who could narrow either one could
reintroduce the bug the mechanism exists to close.

This is the one mechanism in this guide that has been demonstrated rather
than only described: §16.C shows a real `cf-agent` run refusing a gated
service because its precondition genuinely failed.

---

## 13. Peer actions: help without a global lock

Some operations a host cannot perform locally. Example from our last
system: a device that cannot start its privileged helper itself; any
healthy peer in its allowlist may do it over ADB; if every helper is
down, **only that device waits**.

That is a **peer action**: the target declares an operation it cannot do
locally; any helper with the capability **and** on the **target’s** peer
allowlist may do it. Helpers are fungible. Prefer **groups** (“household
helpers”) plus allowed verbs, not only individual keys. Stall is local.
Idempotent. Not a
[distributed lock](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html),
and not Bcfg2’s LISA ’06 state machine over *releases* — those stall the
*fleet* when one box is unreachable.

Cross-machine “wait until the server is serving the new export” is a
**local probe** (or a wait for a signed apply-attestation from the host
that holds that role). Bcfg2’s FSM is a **view** reconstructed from JSONL
plus optional attestations, never a coordinator.

[Bcfg2 `altsrc`](http://docs.bcfg2.org/) still transfers: Termux
`$PREFIX` versus Linux/macOS absolute paths sharing one source.

---

## 14. Per-device trust

`trust_tier` (`operator` | `managed` | `consented`) is a **class**: which
consent gate applies. It is not who trusts whom. Full-mesh “every device
has operator root to every sibling” is **not** the product default. It is
a site-private policy some operator-tier labs may still choose.

Each device carries a **local trust policy** in its signed release
(authored in site-private). It does not phone home to ask.

| Axis | Question | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Release** | Whose signatures may change me? | Site TUF root enrolled at the first-run ceremony |
| **Consent** | Do I also need a local yes? | `operator`: no. `consented`: yes (advisor key). `managed`: operator-chosen |
| **Peer** | Who may act *on* me (ADB, SSH, peer-help)? | Nobody, unless listed. Prefer groups plus allowed verbs |
| **Attestation** | Whose “I applied this” counts for my advisor tools? | Only sets that person configured |
| **Secrets / cache** | Who may receive this secret or substitute this store path? | secretspec resolver; cache keys `operator` only |

Peer actions check the **target’s** peer allowlist, not only “the helper
has a capability.” Identity is the device public key.

A label in inventory does not enforce this. The executor does.

Web-of-trust thresholds (“50% of people I trust have installed this”)
live in the **advisor plug-in**, not in the executor.

---

## 15. Token discovery

Inference removes “you must already know the *edge*.” Naming the *thing*
is a catalog, not a graph.

1. Auto-provide `service:<name>` unless the service opts out.
2. Lookup CLI against registries and compiled provides (`who-provides`,
   `does-role exist`, `tokens kind=service`).
3. Unknown token, unmatched `requires`, or two providers of the same
   token → compile error listing near-misses and the catalog.

Token *kinds* are a closed enum — `service`, `port`, `path`, `class`,
`package`, `device`, `network`, `secret` — defined once in
[`schema/common.schema.json`](../../schema/common.schema.json)
(`$defs.token`). That schema is the authority; if this list and
that pattern ever disagree, the schema is right. Token *values* are
instance data, checked at compile time — not a schema enum that changes
with every new service.

If an author has never heard of the thing they need, lookup and the error
are the discovery path. The writing rule is “don’t require the graph,”
not “don’t require names.”

---

## 16. Three walkthroughs

The inputs below are excerpts from
[`examples/services.yml`](../../examples/services.yml)
— a fixture, schema-validated, not live site data. In **A** and **B** the
outputs (CFEngine JSON, the launchd plist, the promise sketch) are
hand-authored to show the target shape: the compiler’s render stage does
not exist yet, so nothing in those two except the YAML was produced
mechanically. **C** is different — it is the part that was subsequently
built, and everything in it is real. launchd here is one adapter; the same
service record would render a systemd unit or a runit service on another
host.

### A. An ordering edge nobody wrote

`caddy` and `litellm-proxy` sit in the same `edge-http` bundle.
`litellm-proxy` states only what it needs. Nothing in either record says
“start after caddy.”

```yaml
  - name: caddy
    domain: macos-launchd-services
    bundle: edge-http
    platform: macos
    runs_as: djbclark
    command: ["/opt/homebrew/bin/caddy", "run", "--config", "/etc/caddy/Caddyfile"]
    launchd:
      label: com.djbclark.caddy
      run_at_load: true
      keep_alive: true
    provides:
      - service:caddy
      - port:443
      - port:80
    requires:
      - path:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      - service:tailscaled

  - name: litellm-proxy
    domain: macos-launchd-services
    bundle: edge-http
    platform: macos
    runs_as: djbclark
    command: ["/opt/homebrew/bin/litellm", "--config", "/etc/litellm/config.yaml"]
    env:
      LITELLM_MASTER_KEY: LITELLM_MASTER_KEY
      OPENAI_API_KEY: OPENAI_API_KEY
    launchd:
      label: com.djbclark.litellm
    provides:
      - service:litellm
      - port:4000
    requires:
      - service:caddy
      - secret:LITELLM_MASTER_KEY
```

`litellm-proxy`’s `requires: [service:caddy, …]` matches `caddy`’s
`provides: [service:caddy, …]` (and would also match auto-provide of
`service:caddy` from the name alone). The compiler derives an ordering
edge from that match:

This illustration is **preview-channel material and does not load as
Augments.** Both of its top-level keys — `data` and `nix2cf_edges` — are
skipped by CFEngine 3.27.1, so as written this file injects nothing. The
shape the agent actually consumes is `{"vars": {…}}` and nothing else; the
projection onto it runs device-side, after approval. The nesting below is
kept because it shows the *derivation* legibly, which is what this
walkthrough is for — do not copy it onto a device and expect an effect.

```jsonc
// host_specific.json — ILLUSTRATIVE ONLY. Preview channel; does NOT load
// as Augments (top-level `data` and `nix2cf_edges` are both skipped).
{
  "data": {
    "nix2cf_services": {
      "caddy": {
        "service_policy": "start",
        "launchd_label": "com.djbclark.caddy",
        "command": ["/opt/homebrew/bin/caddy", "run", "--config", "/etc/caddy/Caddyfile"],
        "run_as": "djbclark"
      },
      "litellm-proxy": {
        "service_policy": "start",
        "launchd_label": "com.djbclark.litellm",
        "command": ["/opt/homebrew/bin/litellm", "--config", "/etc/litellm/config.yaml"],
        "run_as": "djbclark",
        "env": {
          "LITELLM_MASTER_KEY": "@{secrets.LITELLM_MASTER_KEY}",
          "OPENAI_API_KEY": "@{secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY}"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "nix2cf_edges": [
    {
      "from": "litellm-proxy",
      "to": "caddy",
      "on": "service:caddy",
      "origin": "inferred",
      "rule": "requires-matches-provides",
      "source": { "file": "services.yml", "service": "litellm-proxy", "field": "requires[0]" }
    },
    {
      "from": "caddy",
      "to": "tailscaled",
      "on": "service:tailscaled",
      "origin": "inferred",
      "rule": "requires-matches-provides",
      "source": { "file": "services.yml", "service": "caddy", "field": "requires[1]" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Two edges, not one. `caddy` states `requires: service:tailscaled`, and the
`tailscaled` record in the same fixture (§16.B's `fleet-vpn` bundle)
provides it — so the same rule fires across a bundle boundary without
anyone writing that down either.

`origin` says this edge was never authored. `rule` names the mechanism.
`source` points at the exact `requires` entry. If the edge is wrong, the
question is “does this rule apply to this pair?” — a lookup — not “where
did this ordering come from?” — a search.

The generic bundle behind `nix2cf_services` is what materializes the
on-device artifact. For `caddy` on macOS, that is a launchd plist
CFEngine keeps present and loaded:

```xml
<!-- /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.djbclark.caddy.plist — rendered, not authored -->
<key>Label</key>
<string>com.djbclark.caddy</string>
<key>ProgramArguments</key>
<array>
    <string>/opt/homebrew/bin/caddy</string>
    <string>run</string>
    <string>--config</string>
    <string>/etc/caddy/Caddyfile</string>
</array>
<key>UserName</key>
<string>djbclark</string>
<key>RunAtLoad</key>
<true/>
<key>KeepAlive</key>
<true/>
```

### B. An interlock, from schema to guard

The `fleet-vpn` bundle carries the precondition in §12: lockdown may not
be enforced before the VPN authenticates.

```yaml
bundles:
  fleet-vpn:
    description: "VPN transport and the lockdown policy that depends on it"
    domain: macos-launchd-services
    interlocks:
      - id: tailscale-authenticated-before-lockdown
        description: >-
          The mesh VPN must be authenticated before always-on VPN lockdown
          may be enforced. Setting lockdown on a device whose VPN is
          unauthenticated severs every management path to it.
        pre_action:
          command: ["tailscale", "status", "--json"]
          expect_exit: 0
          timeout_seconds: 15
        defines_class: tailscale_authenticated
        blocks: enclosing-bundle
        report: true
```

`blocks` and `report` are constants in the schema. An author cannot narrow
the blast radius or silence the report.

```cfengine
# ILLUSTRATIVE — not compiler output
bundle agent fleet_vpn
{
  classes:
      "tailscale_authenticated"
        expression => returnszero("/usr/local/bin/tailscale status --json", useshell);

  methods:
      "guard"
        usebundle => report_if_missing_class("tailscale_authenticated",
                       "fleet-vpn: blocked, VPN not authenticated");

  services:
      "tailscaled"
        service_policy => "start",
        ifvarclass => "tailscale_authenticated";
}
```

The guard is attached once, at the bundle, and inherited by every promise
in it — because the schema gave the render stage no field to read a
narrower scope from.

### C. The same interlock, actually running

A and B show intent. This shows the two artifacts that were built
afterwards, so a reader can tell which parts of this guide are argument and
which are code.

The projection of §7, applied to a goal file, produces
[`examples/host_specific.json`](../../examples/host_specific.json) — the
only shape the agent actually reads. It is canonical bytes on disk (one
line, sorted keys); pretty-printed and trimmed to one service here:

```json
{
  "vars": {
    "tendcf_service": {
      "com.tendcf.caddy.main": {
        "bundle": "caddy",
        "command": ["/opt/homebrew/bin/caddy", "run",
                    "--config", "/etc/caddy/Caddyfile"],
        "env": { "CADDY_ADMIN_TOKEN": "CADDY_ADMIN_TOKEN" },
        "run_as": "caddy",
        "state": "present",
        "unit": { "launchd": { "keep_alive": true, "run_at_load": true } },
        "working_dir": "/"
      },
      "com.tendcf.caddy.retired": { "state": "absent" }
    }
  }
}
```

Two design claims are visible as data rather than prose.
`com.tendcf.caddy.retired` says `"state": "absent"` and is *still in the
file* — the tombstone of §7, which is what makes a removal converge instead
of evaporating when a device catches up across several releases. And `env`
maps a variable name to a secret **name**, never a value; a resolved secret
in that position is a load-breaking error, not a warning.

The bundle that reads it is where every decision lives, because the
projection makes none. Two of its mechanics were forced by CFEngine rather
than chosen, and neither was guessed:

- Entry ids are launchd labels (`com.tendcf.caddy.main`) and bundle tags
  are kebab-case. **CFEngine class names accept neither dots nor hyphens** —
  a raw hyphenated class is rejected outright. So anything that becomes part
  of a class name is passed through `canonify()` first, while the raw id is
  kept for data lookups and for the plist `Label`, where the real value is
  required.
- The blast radius is keyed on the interlock’s **own bundle tag**, not on
  which service happens to reference it, so several interlocks sharing a tag
  combine without any join against the service list. That is §12’s
  “enclosing-bundle” constant, made mechanical.

**The refusal was tested for real.**
[`examples/policy/host_specific-interlock-blocked.json`](../../examples/policy/host_specific-interlock-blocked.json)
declares a service whose bundle carries an interlock whose check is
`/bin/false` — a command that genuinely fails, not a mocked failure — and a
real, non-dry-run `cf-agent` run confirms the gated service’s promises are
skipped and the refusal reported. It is a small result. It is also the only
place in this guide where a mechanism is demonstrated rather than described.

Three limits, since v1 invites over-reading. It is **launchd-only**. It
renders the plist through mustache templating, which does **not** do
CFEngine’s own `$()` substitution, so anything needing expansion must be
expanded before it reaches the template. And the interlock’s command is
reassembled into a shell string, because CFEngine will not accept an indexed
container element as a non-scalar attribute — so an argument containing a
space or a shell metacharacter is not currently isolated. That input comes
from our own schema-checked goal file rather than from an attacker, which
makes it a limitation rather than a hole, but it is one we would rather a
reader found here than in the code.

---

## 17. Where a different design is a better fit

Every choice above is scoped to a specific envelope: a fleet small enough
that no single role is dedicated to operating it, mixed enough that no
OS-native tool covers it alone, and connected intermittently enough that
waiting on a reachable central server is not an option. This section names
the points at which a *different* architecture — not a variant of this one
— is the better choice.

The first three bound the mechanisms borrowed from Bcfg2. They are the
comfortable ones: there is prior art, a reader can check them, and this
fleet is arguably already over two of them. The rest bound the trust and
consent layer — the part with no prior art, the part the implementer map’s
§0 calls the point, and the part with the most to lose. Each limit is stated
with something the design could actually measure, because a limit nobody can
observe themselves crossing is a disclaimer rather than a ceiling.

**The mechanisms with prior art**

- **Local-first reporting stops paying for itself once a fleet-wide query
  becomes routine rather than exceptional.** A JSONL record per device is
  free for as long as “did host X converge” is the dominant question. Once
  “did the rollout land everywhere” needs an answer with bounded staleness
  often enough to matter, the honest fix is a central statistics spine
  (the shape Bcfg2 already builds), not a federation layer retrofitted
  onto a local-first design. Measure the ratio of fleet-scope to host-scope
  questions asked per month — and note that for a household fleet “are all
  my phones up right now” is already the ordinary question, so this limit
  may be behind us rather than ahead.
- **Derived dependency edges stop being the cheaper mechanism once role
  interleaving is the common case rather than the exception.** Inference
  earns its keep where explicit edges would otherwise be rare, which is
  where roles are largely independent. A site where most roles genuinely
  depend on several others has an ordering problem that has become
  Puppet’s catalog-compilation problem, and a design built to resolve one
  true graph deterministically is then the better fit. Measure inferred
  cross-role edges as a fraction of all edges — which cannot be measured
  until the compiler’s inference stage exists (§18, step 3).
- **The signed-release-as-artifact model stops being adequate once changes
  must land on a bounded clock across the whole fleet** — an
  active-incident patch under a compliance deadline, for instance.
  Ahead-of-time rendering optimizes for devices that are routinely
  unreachable at authoring time. A fleet whose devices are reliably
  reachable and whose changes carry real time pressure is better served by
  render-on-request (Bcfg2’s model) or a push-capable policy server. Measure
  p95 release-to-converged latency by trust tier, with the count of devices
  never reached — and note that patching the daily-driver Mac carries a
  bounded clock every single time.

**The trust and consent layer**

- **The consent gate does not yet mean what §8 says it means, and that is a
  standing limit rather than one this fleet grows into.** Every control in
  the gate is authored, delivered, and evaluated by the party it exists to
  constrain: the trust policy arrives in the release, the advisor key is
  enrolled in site-private, the briefing is generated upstream, and the
  nonce and the validator ship from the same place as the change. The one
  artifact the consenting person genuinely contributes is a signature. That
  defeats a network attacker and it produces an honest audit trail; it is
  not sovereignty against the proposer. The smallest change that fixes the
  class rather than the instances is a **device-local trust root the release
  path cannot write** — advisor key, consent policy, peer allowlist, and the
  device’s own resource policy established at first run into storage the
  validator reads and no release can modify, with changes to any of them
  requiring the current advisor key plus a local human act. Until that
  exists, a site that needs the property §8 describes needs a different trust
  architecture, not a better schema.
- **Refusal is offered, not exercised, and nothing here has had to reconcile
  a device that said no.** Every mechanism converges toward one authored
  intent; the stated purpose is to let people diverge from it. There is no
  reconciliation path, no protocol version, no skew budget, and no re-entry
  of a personal branch into §4’s conflict check. The refuse-and-re-render
  loop assumes refusal is the exception. Once per-device divergence is the
  normal state, the fleet needs a design where shared invariants are
  negotiated between sovereign devices rather than compiled from one source.
  Measure refusals per release, and how many releases a refused device stays
  behind.
- **The signing model is sized for one operator and §1 promises more than
  one.** The limit is the second operator who must author a release without
  the first’s key: threshold signing, delegation, per-role scoping,
  co-operator revocation. That is a different trust architecture, and it is
  triggered by a condition §1 states as already true.
- **A comparison of two documents bounds what is described, not what
  happens on the way there.** The validator can refuse a declaration; it
  cannot refuse an effect. A package install runs the vendor’s maintainer
  scripts as root, and a `command:` is arbitrary code at launch. Where the
  threat is hostile effects rather than hostile declarations, the answer is
  OS-level confinement — a different enclosure, not a different plan format
  — and this design does not have one.
- **The threat model outgrows this design at the compromised authoring
  agent.** Most of the configuration is written by AI agents (§9). A
  prompt-injected authoring agent that produces a Site Model compiling to a
  valid, signed goal file, briefed to the reviewer’s own model by a
  generated semantic layer, is inside every control described here. Past
  that point the answer is two-party authoring review, an independent party
  reproducing the release from the Site Model, or n-of-m sign-off — none of
  which is this design.
- **Below some engineering budget, a much smaller system delivers most of
  this.** Every limit above assumes the system exists; §18 says most of it
  does not, and there is one builder. A signed tarball of rendered per-host
  state plus a convergent applier is a large fraction of the value at a
  fraction of the cost. A reader deciding whether to adopt needs that
  boundary more than any of the others.
- **The AI-authorship premise bounds the design from both sides.** If agents
  become reliable over long contexts and tool-mediated lookup is cheap, the
  local-knowledge scaffolding is unnecessary and an ordinary catalog
  compiler wins. If agents are worse than assumed — fluent,
  schema-conformant, and semantically wrong — then types are the wrong
  defense, and what is needed is a review-and-test loop: property tests over
  rendered output, differential runs against the previous release. §20 asks
  this as a question; here it is the boundary.

---

## 18. What is built, and what is next

**Built today**

- **Eight schemas** in this repository (`schema/`, `examples/`). Five are
  the Site Model and its reporting — `provides` / `requires` per type,
  `interlocks` per bundle, `comprehensive` plus `opt_out_reason` per
  domain, and the report row (release stamp, separate managed /
  not-yet-migrated / deliberately-unmanaged counters). Three are the
  consent contract of §7: the goal file, the structural diff, and the
  approval record.
- A lint that carries the cross-file rules JSON Schema cannot state
  alone: reference resolution, launchd labels checked against declared
  writer prefixes, no prefix nested inside another. A second lint checks
  that every cross-reference in the documentation resolves.
- **Ninety-two deliberately broken fixtures**, every one of which the lint
  must catch, and it fails if any is accepted. A passing lint on correct
  input is not a check. They come in three kinds: fifty-nine schema-level
  (an opt-out with no reason, a rogue launchd label, a literal secret where
  a key name belongs, a proposer setting a privileged flag, a migration
  that is not a no-op); six byte-level, which exist because a
  canonicalization fault is invisible once the file has been parsed (a
  pretty-printed twin, duplicate keys, a non-NFC path, `15.0` where `15`
  belongs); and twenty-seven projection-level (a resolved secret value
  where a name belongs, a goal file smuggled in under `vars`). Each rule in
  the projector’s checker has a fixture that trips **that rule alone** —
  a suite where one fixture trips three rules cannot tell you the other two
  work.
- **A reference projector** (`bin/projector.py`) for §7’s projection step,
  gated in CI against golden bytes so the agent’s eventual second
  implementation has something to agree with.
- **A first generic bundle** (`policy/tendcf_services.cf`), launchd only —
  the first thing here that CFEngine actually executes (§16.C).
- **A patch overlay on libntech and cfengine/core** (`overlay/`,
  `bin/overlay.py`): the six fork commits that bundle depends on (§19),
  pinned to one upstream commit per component, with a lint, a self-test, a
  drift check against upstream, and a retirement check, so the "correct
  build" the bundle was verified against is reproducible from this
  repository alone.
- **A design for the change process** — lockfile, release, rollback, CI
  gates — in `docs/architecture/change-process.md`. Design only: the
  resolver and the release pipeline are Step 6 code.

**Not built — this is still most of it**

The compiler `nix2cf` itself (merge, conflict check, inference, render),
every supervisor adapter except launchd, the signed release path, the
on-device validator, the consent surface, and the peer-action runtime. No
operational numbers of any kind.

**Build order from here** (each step is meant to leave the system in a
coherent, describable state):

| Step | What | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Schemas in tendcf | Existing contract is `schema/` + `examples/` + `bin/schema_lint.py`. Remaining: peer_actions, trust-policy shape, generic unit-writers, lookup stub, YAML canonicalize. Transcribe reality (`not-yet-migrated` is the correct day-one state). |
| 1 | macOS services adapter | **Started.** `policy/tendcf_services.cf` renders and loads launchd services from projected data, with interlocks enforced (§16.C). Still open in this step: package and file promises, environment rendering, the unit-writer detector. Dry-run default. Not in this step: nix-darwin. |
| 2 | Android under the Site Model | Same vocabulary. Agent owns JSONL+SQLite in app-private storage. |
| 3 | `nix2cf` compiler | “What would device X receive?” first, then conflict check, extra-entry reporting, then inference. Inference waits until types exist on two platforms. |
| 4 | Linux reference path | A stock distro, not NixOS. Distro choice is open until this step; Ubuntu Server is the working default. |
| 5 | First real Linux host | A second node that can hold backup roles. Proves that roles are data. |
| 6 | Signed releases, push-only | TUF-subset ceremony; goal-file render and diff; the on-device validator. Operator hosts only. |
| 7 | Mac substrate (optional) | nix-darwin + home-manager if that path is chosen. Reversible. Services remain CFEngine from step 1. |
| 8 | Pull | Any host with the role self-updates. The no-control-node end state, reached by editing `roles.yml`. |
| 9 | Consent / sovereignty | Advisor slot + default prompt. Their AI, our accept/reject. |
| 10+ | Demand-driven | Builder/cache, reproducible APK provenance, WoT as advisor tools, extracting the publishable layer when a second person runs it. |

On the first platform brought under management — the primary workstation,
which cannot easily be reimaged — dry-run is the standing posture.
Reporting (“what changed, what is dirty, what release am I on”) is an
adoption requirement, not an observability extra.

## 19. What we found underneath

This design bets everything on one thing: that the right place to put a
compiler’s output is CFEngine’s own JSON data layer, so the policy text
stays generic and every site-specific fact arrives as data (§4). Acting on
that bet meant pushing far more through `def.json` and `host_specific.json`
than an ordinary CFEngine deployment does, where a policy server ships
policy *text* and augments carry a thin slice of variables.

Every time we leaned on that layer, something under it broke.

Between 2026-08-15 and 2026-08-18 we opened **twenty-six pull requests**
against [cfengine/core](https://github.com/cfengine/core) (twenty) and
[NorthernTechHQ/libntech](https://github.com/NorthernTechHQ/libntech) (six),
tracked as CFE-4715–CFE-4740 in the CFEngine Jira. Twenty-three carry a
defect fix; two are features and one is pure test coverage. **On 2026-08-19
upstream closed all twenty-six pull requests and rejected all twenty-six
tickets** — on review volume, not on any technical finding. The maintainer
asked that we restart with one bug report and one small pull request, and
that a human rather than an LLM be in the loop for each. That is a fair thing
to ask of someone who has just put twenty-six items in front of a small team,
and we do not dispute it. But not one of the defects below was rebutted,
reproduced-and-denied, or shown to be a non-issue; the fixes and their
discrimination tests still exist, on our fork rather than in front of
upstream. Every count here is a count of what we found and submitted, not of
what is pending review — the open count upstream is zero. **Twenty-two of
the twenty-three defect fixes ship a test.** The one exception is documented
on the pull request rather than quietly left, and we went back and tried to
close it rather than leaving the number where it was. It cannot be closed:
that fix clears an alarm which a function it calls immediately re-arms on
every path, so a build with the fix and a build without it behave
identically from outside. Any test there would be asserting a difference the
program does not have — the same fault as the codec above, only committed on
purpose. The bar has been
**discrimination** — showing the test fails without the fix and passes with
it — not merely that a test exists.
The full record — measurements, branches, review panels, and
the corrections our *own* claims turned out to need — is
[`docs/architecture/upstream-register.md`](../architecture/upstream-register.md).

**Ten of those defects are in the data path this design depends on**, and
three of them stop a run before it evaluates a single promise — dropping the
host to failsafe — on input a correct compiler would legitimately produce:

- A JSON `null` anywhere in `host_specific.json` segfaults `cf-promises`
  and `cf-agent` *before a single promise is evaluated*, so the host drops
  to failsafe. It is valid JSON and it passes CFEngine’s own checks.
- The same root cause sits in the `def.json` loader, at three places.
- A **valid** JSON number written in exponent form without a decimal point
  — `1e-8` — is misclassified as an integer and reaches an exit-on-error
  path. So do integers larger than a C `long`.

The other seven are quieter and, in a configuration system, arguably worse:
one malformed entry silently discarding every other entry in its section;
rejected data that names no key, no value and no file; a key containing a
dot silently becoming a scope path; reals rendered to two decimal places so
`0.00049` becomes `0.00`; *copying* a document changing its numbers; and a
JSON string codec wrong in both directions, so `{"city":"中国"}` reads back
as the literal text `u4e2du56fd`.

### Why they were still there

The count is not the interesting part. These are old, shallow defects in
code that has tests. Two things explain that, and both are §9’s second rule
— prefer machine-checkable to conventional — seen from the outside.

**A codec tested only against itself cannot find a fault its two halves
share.** The reader and the writer were exact inverses: the writer escaped
each byte, the reader turned those escapes back into the same bytes. The
library round-tripped its own output perfectly, so *no write-then-read test
could catch either half*. The bug is visible only from outside, against
someone else’s decoder. There was a test suite. It was measuring
self-consistency and reporting it as correctness.

**Coverage was thinnest exactly where this design leans hardest.** The
mustache renderer — 916 lines, one entry point, and the thing our generic
bundle uses to write every unit file — had **no unit tests at all**.
Writing seventeen surfaced two more defects immediately, which is about
what nine hundred untested lines should be expected to yield.

Neither point is a criticism of the maintainers, who have been responsive
and, on the two reviews we have had, sharp. Both are observations about
where test effort naturally lands: on the paths a project’s own deployment
shape exercises. A design that routes its traffic somewhere else is, in
effect, a new test suite — and ours came back red.

### What it costs us

- **This project currently depends on a fork.** Our builds come from a
  branch merging all twenty-three fixes. If none land, tendcf ships against
  a patched CFEngine permanently, which is a real maintenance liability.
- **The channel is open but slow.** For weeks the pull requests drew only
  bots. On 2026-08-18 two Northern.tech maintainers reviewed properly — the
  first genuine engagement, and enough to retire the “no upstream response”
  framing. Both independently asked for less verbosity. Nothing has merged.
- **Time spent here is time not spent building.** §18 says most of this
  system does not exist. One person who answers every discovered defect by
  fixing it upstream has chosen a contribution to someone else’s codebase
  over a working system of their own. That may well be the right call. It
  is a call, and it should be visible as one.
- **We cannot tell you whether twenty-three is a lot.** There is no base
  rate here — no comparable figure for a similarly intense month against any
  other mature configuration engine. Reading this as “CFEngine is unusually
  buggy” goes past the evidence. The defensible claim is narrower: *a
  compile-to-data design stresses a different surface than the tool’s own
  deployment model, and that surface was less exercised.*

### Who wrote the fixes

§9 says most of this system’s configuration will be written by AI agents, and
this section is the largest body of work the project has produced, so it
would be odd to report it without saying how it was made. The defects were
found by AI agents doing ordinary development work against CFEngine, and most
of the fixes were drafted by them too.

What made them submittable was the gate placed afterwards, not the drafting.
Every fix had to carry a **discrimination proof** — revert it, watch the test
fail with the exact symptom, restore it, watch it pass — and most went through
an adversarial review panel of two to four independent models working from a
frozen brief, whose findings were binding. Those panels caught real problems:
a fix that read a flag before the call that sets it; a platform guard that
would have silently disabled `exec_timeout` on Cygwin where no CI job would
have noticed; a test that could not have failed for the reason it claimed. They
also caught several of **our own claims to upstream** that were overstated —
including one that forced a correcting follow-up to an external security team,
and one severity assessment we had to retract and rewrite.

That cuts both ways, and the second half matters more. Machine authors did
produce twenty-three reviewable patches to a mature C codebase. They also
produced a steady stream of confident, plausible, wrong statements — about
severity, about line numbers, about what had been tested rather than merely
looked tested. That is exactly the failure §9 describes, turning up in prose
instead of in configuration. What worked was not better authorship. It was
making each claim checkable and then running the check.

### One last thing, and it cuts against §9

None of these ten defects would have been caught by any amount of schema
design at our layer. They sit *below* the surface the schemas defend. If the
argument of §9 is that machine authors fail at global consistency and types
are the answer, this section is the reminder that types bind only the layer
they are written for, and that everything underneath is still ordinary
software with ordinary bugs.

## 20. Open questions

These are the places the current design is weakest.

1. **Is inference justified?** Retry-until-stable already requires no
   author to know anything about ordering. If that is already the
   local-knowledge mechanism, `provides` / `requires` is extra machinery
   for a problem that was already solved.
2. **Is the writing rule an argument or a hypothesis?** A counter-example
   would be a place where forcing an author to state a global constraint
   is what *caught* a bug.
3. **Do `not-yet-migrated` counts actually get ground down, or
   accumulate?** Bcfg2’s deployment had a person whose job that was. A
   fleet in this envelope has no such role. If the count only ever rises,
   default-on comprehensiveness is a permanent tax with no payoff.
4. **Is per-domain the right granularity?** A domain is a boundary someone
   has to draw. A badly drawn one hides drift inside itself as effectively
   as opting out would.
5. **Is local-first the wrong call?** Bcfg2’s operators found that
   network-wide reports were what actually bought administrator trust.
   “No consumer yet for a central copy” is exactly the reasoning that
   finding warns against.
6. **When a genuinely global question arrives, is querying reachable
   devices and treating the rest as unknown enough?**
7. **Does edge origin information actually work?** Nobody has run it. If
   it does not, inference has a silent failure mode.
8. **Does the goal-file schema keep up with real operations?** What cannot
   be expressed in the goal file cannot be rendered *or* approved: the
   compiler and the validator fail together, so coverage closes by
   construction rather than by discipline. The pressure lands somewhere
   else instead — on declaring a domain `not-yet-migrated` to get a change
   out the door. That is question 3 above wearing a different hat, and it
   is the same failure: reclassification, not accumulation.
9. **Is the whole premise the wrong shape?** The design hardens the
   surface where a machine author lacks global context. If the real
   weakness is plausible-looking output that type systems do not catch,
   the schemas are defending the wrong wall.
10. **Is a diff something a person can actually consent to?** “One service
    installed, nothing else” is a sentence someone can hold in their head.
    “Forty-one entries changed across your goal file” is not. Everything
    that makes a large diff holdable — the on-demand provenance query,
    display grouping, the briefing itself — is advisory machinery that
    never widens what the validator accepts. That is what keeps it safe,
    and also what makes it the first thing dropped under pressure. The test
    is countable once real diffs exist: how many entries a typical release
    touches, and how often a person reads past the first screen.
11. **Do the total-diff events stay rare?** First adoption is bounded by
    what it may claim, and a migration is valid only if it changes nothing.
    A project with high schema churn still hands its reviewer a recurring
    “everything moved, this one is fine” event, which is training for
    exactly the rubber stamp the consent gate exists to prevent. Count
    migration releases per year; if that number is not small, the ceremony
    is being spent.
12. **Does refusing actually cost the proposer anything?** A refusal buys a
    re-render, not a stalemate — that is deliberate, since the alternative
    is a partial apply of a state nobody checked. But nothing in the
    mechanism stops the same bundle being offered again, and a proposer who
    is patient wins once. The design’s answer is that persistent re-offers
    of refused content are visible in the record. Whether visibility is
    enough when the proposer and the person are the same operator is
    untested.
13. **What protects the stored baseline?** The device’s copy of the
    currently-approved goal file is the root of the gate: everything is
    diffed against it, every approval binds to it. Integrity-protected
    storage is easy to write down and platform-specific to build, and
    Android under Termux is the awkward case — the same place §6 already
    has to solve ownership of the local record.
14. **What holds the policy tree — which is code — inside the reviewed
    state?** The generic bundle, and any hand-written `.cf` alongside it,
    are what turn a goal file into promises. Nothing about the diff
    constrains them unless the goal file carries the policy tree’s digest
    as a privileged region. That is an obligation on a schema not yet
    written, not a property the design has today.
15. **Can the consent gate be made to mean what it says?** Comparing two
    documents changes what the person is shown and what the device will
    accept. It does not change who wrote the validator, who enrolled the
    advisor key, who generates the briefing, or who decides what counts as
    a privileged region — §17 states that limit and names the smallest fix.
    Whether a device-local trust root the release path cannot write is
    buildable across macOS, Linux, and Android by one person is open, and
    the rest of the consent layer rests on the answer.
16. **What confirms that a change took effect?** A device can compare
    documents, and CFEngine can show what a run would change to files and
    packages, but “the new unit is loaded and running” is not something the
    device can confirm back to the person who approved it. That gap is
    permanent at this layer, and every confirmation this design offers has
    to be read with it in mind.

The schemas most of the later questions turn on — goal file, diff, approval
record — **are now written** and have been through the independent
adversarial review the implementer map held them for at its §14.2. That
review changed them, and two of its findings were corrections to claims this
project had made about its own work rather than to the schemas: a
specification sentence that had been promoted out of an illustrative sketch
without its “illustrative” marking, and a set of counts asserted from memory
that a later audit re-measured and found wrong. Both are recorded rather
than quietly fixed, which is the same reason §19 exists. What is *not*
written is the code those schemas describe — the validator, the release
path, the consent surface — so the questions above are still open in the
way that matters.

Token discovery (how an author finds the right name) is a mechanism
(§15), not an open question. Whether authors actually use the lookup and
the error catalog is still untested.
