# Projector mapping reconciliation — 2026-08-16

Status: **decided**. This document closes the last open item of
`goal-file-schema-reconciliation-2026-08-15.md` §18 — the projector goldens
of §13, which could not be built because the mapping they were to be goldens
*of* had never been specified.

What was already decided and is **not** reopened here: the projector runs
device-side, inside tendcf-agent, after approval; its target is
`$(sys.workdir)/data/host_specific.json` and nothing else; its output is
`{"vars": {…}}` with no sibling keys (§9, and §13's adopted negative). What
this document adds is the mapping: which entries project, under what names,
in what bytes.

*Amended 2026-11-02 (operator; `architecture-DEFINITIVE-v3.md` D45):*
"inside tendcf-agent" now holds on Android only. On Linux and macOS the
projector runs in `tendcf-validate`, the Python command `bin/projector.py`
is promoted to. §9 and R22 below are amended to match.

**Citation convention.** An unqualified `§N` here always means a section of
`goal-file-schema-reconciliation-2026-08-15.md`, the document this one
continues; the guide and the map are named where cited. This document's own
clauses are never `§N` — they are `P-n` (decisions), `N-n` (negatives), `E-n`
(measured CFEngine behaviour) and `C-n` / `R2n` (register), so a bare `§` never
points inward.

## 0. Method, and why the CFEngine claims here are load-bearing

Three independent opinions were collected cold — Gemini 3.1 Pro, Grok 4.6
(xAI), Cursor Grok 4.6 — each answering the same seven questions and each
required to print a complete worked projection so the positions would be
falsifiable rather than rhetorical. They are checked in beside this document
as `projector-opinion-{gemini,grok,cursor}.md`.

A fourth pass audited every citation in all three against the corpus and
against the **installed CFEngine 3.27.1 binary**, and this changed the
outcome. Two claims were refuted by live probe, one of them the mechanism the
minority position rested on. The probes below were re-run independently
before deciding; the CFEngine source they cite is byte-identical between
3.27.1 and the local checkout for `libpromises/cmdb.c`, `cmdb.h`, and
`var_expressions.h`.

The empirical findings that decide this document:

| # | Behaviour on 3.27.1 | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| E-1 | An unscoped `vars` key lands at **`data:variables.<key>`**, tagged `source=cmdb`. | `cmdb.c:96–118`, `cmdb.h:31`; live `--show-vars` |
| E-2 | **`$(def.<key>)` does not expand** for `host_specific.json` keys. | Live: `DEF=[$(def.tendcf_service)]`, literal. `scope="def"` exists only on the `def.json` path (`generic_agent.c:447,567` in 3.27.1; those assignments sit at 453/573 in the local 3.28.0-111 checkout, and citing the checkout's numbers for a 3.27.1 claim was an error — see C-2) |
| E-3 | A **dotted** flat key is parsed as a scope path: `com.dotted.key` installs as `data:com.dotted.key`, scope `com`. | Live `--show-vars` |
| E-4 | Top-level primitives **stringify**; booleans and integers survive typed only **inside a container**. | `AddCMDBVariable`, `cmdb.c:121,131,140,152`; live `KEEPALIVE=[true]`, `EXIT=[0]` |
| E-5 | `$(`, `${`, `@{`, `@(` anywhere in `vars` fails the **entire** CMDB load, not just that key. | `var_expressions.h:90–97`, `cmdb.c:182`; live `error: Failed to load CMDB data` |
| E-6 | Only `vars`, `classes`, `variables` are legal top-level keys; others warn-and-skip. | `cmdb.c:542–546`; live `warning: Invalid key 'data' … skipping it` |
| E-7 | `variables` is loaded after `vars` and **overwrites** the same name. | `cmdb.c:550–560`; live `DUP=[from_variables]` |
| E-8 | A float `3.5` is installed as the **string** `"3.50"`. | live `Installing CMDB variable 'data:variables.afloat=3.50'` |
| E-9 | 5 MiB `HOST_SPECIFIC_DATA_MAX_SIZE` is a **hard** load failure. | `cmdb.c:38,522–527` |

One refutation is recorded against an opinion that otherwise won its
question: **hyphens are legal** in a `vars` key and expand correctly (live:
`HYPHEN=[hyp]`). Cursor's hyphen→underscore rule is adopted below, but *not*
for the reason Cursor gave, and the false justification is retired here so it
does not propagate.

## 1. P-1 — Only `supervision`'s `service` and `interlock` entries project

**Decision: the projection contains `supervision.entries.service` and
`supervision.entries.interlock`, and nothing else.** Not `device-trust`, not
`unit-writer`, not `coverage`, not `host`, not `schema_version`.

Grok and Cursor's position, adopted 2-1 over Gemini's whole-file wrap.

Gemini's argument is the serious one and deserves the answer: any include
table is a rule about what the data *means*, and a rule about meaning is
Model A's interpreter relocated rather than abolished. Three things defeat it.

1. **Its mechanism does not exist.** Gemini's addressing is
   `$(def.tendcf[domains][supervision][entries][service][id][state])`. Per
   E-2 that expands to nothing on 3.27.1; `def.` is the `def.json` scope, and
   `host_specific.json` lands under `data:variables`. The whole-file wrap is
   not merely more expensive than the alternative, it does not address.
2. **The filter is structural, not value-inspecting.** It keys on *domain
   class* and *kind* — positions in the schema whose vocabularies are closed
   and disjoint (`goal-file.schema.json:54`, `state_entries`: "Kinds are a
   closed set per schema_version"), fixed at schema-authoring time
   and never read from an entry body. R21's tripwire names inspection of
   entry **values**. A kind table is re-keying; that is exactly what R21
   licenses.
3. **The decided text already says trust does not go here.** R21's third
   arrow is `trust entries → the agent's own config`. The projector writes
   exactly one file and that file is not the agent's config, so the decided
   mapping routes trust entries *away* from the projection. Gemini's "project
   everything" contradicts R21 directly, which Gemini acknowledged.

The cost Gemini names is real and is accepted: whoever adds a future kind
must decide whether it projects. That editorial surface is the price, and it
is bounded by being a schema-level decision made once per kind, in the open,
rather than a per-entry one.

The confidentiality argument is upgraded from how the opinions put it. Per
E-1 every projected byte becomes an eval-context variable readable by every
bundle and dumped by `cf-promises --show-vars`. Projecting `device-trust`
would publish the advisor public key, the consent tier, the agent binary pin
and the policy-tree digest into the mutation engine's readable namespace —
creating a second read path for precisely the region
`goal-file.schema.json:232` reserves ("The validator and agent read their own
configuration ONLY from here"). That is a second source of truth, which the
corpus treats as a defect independent of whether anyone can write to it.

`unit-writer` does not project because it is detector data, not actuated
state (`goal-file.schema.json:209`); projecting the prefix registry would
invite a bundle to grow a sweeper over it, which is the extra-entry path the
corpus deliberately keeps report-only (§6, D16(d)).

## 2. P-2 — Two kind containers, `tendcf_service` and `tendcf_interlock`

**Decision: `vars` holds a closed set of kind containers named
`tendcf_<kind>`, each an object keyed by entry id, with the entry body copied
verbatim. Addressing is `$(data:variables.tendcf_service[<id>][<field>])`.**

Forced almost entirely by measurement rather than taste:

- Entry ids **must** be container indices, never key components. `E-3`: an id
  like `com.tendcf.caddy.main` in a flat key installs as scope `com`. Ids are
  reverse-DNS by construction, so this is not a corner case, it is every
  service.
- The container is **required for type fidelity**. E-4: `keep_alive: true`
  and `expect_exit: 0` survive as a boolean and an integer only inside a
  container; at top level they would stringify. A flat projection silently
  changes types.
- Ids are **not canonified**. They are the promiser and the launchd label
  (`goal-file.schema.json:77,122`); rewriting them would be a second spelling
  of identity. E-3 also confirms `getindices()` returns dotted indices intact,
  so nothing downstream needs the rewrite.
- The **kind token** is lowercased with `-`→`_`. Adopted as convention only.
  Cursor's stated reason — that hyphens are illegal in CFEngine identifiers —
  is **false on 3.27.1** and is retired here. The real reason is weaker and
  should be recorded as such: it keeps container names in one lexical class,
  and the rule is presently vacuous because neither projecting kind has a
  hyphen. It exists so a future hyphenated kind does not have to relitigate.

Gemini's single-container `tendcf` shape is rejected with its addressing, but
its warning against invented delimiters is honoured: there are none here.
Depth comes from real containers, and the only synthesised token is the fixed
`tendcf_` prefix.

## 3. P-3 — Tombstones stay in the same container, and R21's second arrow is clarified

**Decision: an entry with `state: "absent"` appears in its kind container
exactly like any other entry, with its `state` field copied. There is no
parallel absent-list, and no entry is dropped for being absent.**

All three opinions reached this independently and all three refused R21's
`tombstones → the negative-promise lists`. A 3-0 refusal of decided text is
not something to wave through, so the clause is resolved rather than ignored.

**The tension, stated exactly.** R21 says the projector is "a structural
re-keying only (entries → the generic bundle's containers, tombstones → the
negative-promise lists, trust entries → the agent's own config)" and, in the
same breath, that "any change that inspects entry *values* to decide output
*structure* is the interpreter returning". Routing on `state` is a conditional
on an entry value selecting an output container. Read as a specification of
projector output, the two halves cannot both hold.

**Resolution: C-1 — the second arrow is withdrawn as a sketch-promotion
error. It is an amendment, and is filed as one.**

An earlier draft of this document resolved the tension by reading R21's arrow
chain as system-level dataflow rather than projector output — arguing that
since arrow three ("trust entries → the agent's own config") cannot be
projector output, arrow two need not be either, so CFEngine renders the
negative promises from `state` at evaluation time. That reading was
adversarially reviewed and **refuted**. It is recorded here rather than
quietly deleted, because the refutation is the reason this clause is now an
amendment instead of a clarification.

It failed on three counts:

1. **The inference does not follow.** That arrow three is not projector output
   establishes only that the list is *not uniformly* an output spec. It does
   not select dataflow over the other candidates. The audit this document was
   built from said "if arrow three is not projector output, arrow two *need
   not* be either"; the draft upgraded that to "arrow two reads the same way".
   Possibility is not identity, and a heterogeneous list does not become
   uniformly dataflow because one member is.
2. **It was special pleading.** §1 of this document uses arrow three as a
   *binding output constraint* — the reason trust entries are routed away
   from the projection. §3 used the same arrow as proof the chain is *not* an
   output spec. The extra hop was granted only to the arrow that would
   otherwise force a tombstone split.
3. **Provenance inverts it.** The parenthetical is compressed from Fable's
   opinion, which reads "tombstones → the negative-promise lists **the generic
   bundle iterates**, trust entries → the *validator's* own config"
   (`goal-file-schema-opinion-fable.md:393–396`). "Iterates" names an *input
   the bundle walks* — projector output — not something the bundle renders at
   eval time. The 2026-08-15 copy dropped that qualifier
   (`reconciliation:527–529`). The dataflow reading does not recover a meaning
   the text always had; it inverts the words that were dropped.

The same provenance supplies the correct resolution. Fable's arrow one reads
"entries → `nix2cf_services`-style containers" — the guide §16.A preview-channel
vocabulary that this corpus has *already* demoted once, as C-9, for describing a
shape that does not load. The arrow chain is an illustrative sketch that was
promoted into decided prose without the ILLUSTRATIVE stamp §16.A received, and
lost a load-bearing qualifier on the way.

**So: the second arrow, read as a specification of projector output
containers, is withdrawn.** The tripwire in the same sentence is untouched and
keeps full force — it is now mechanical, as N-1. Arrow one stands and is what
P-2 implements. Arrow three stands and is what P-1 relies on. R21's filed
register entry (`reconciliation:1233`) already states the residue with **no
arrows at all** — "policy-free by discipline, not construction; value-inspecting
structure decisions are the interpreter returning" — so withdrawing the arrow
costs the register nothing.

This is an override of decided text, and calling it a clarification would have
been false: either the three opinions refused decided text, in which case the
operative meaning has changed, or they refused a misreading, in which case
"a 3-0 refusal of decided text" above would itself be wrong. The first is
true. C-1 is therefore filed in the same genre as the 2026-08-15 §15 register
(C-4 "corrected as written", C-9 the guide's Augments illustration), not
buried as a residue id — residue ids carry new costs, and are not the house
form for recording that yesterday's sentence has been overruled.

**P-3 does not depend on any of this.** It is independently forced, which is
why the mapping, the projector and the golden are unaffected by the refutation:

1. **C-4.** The tombstone persists in the goal file and the negative promise
   renders from the file; the projector is a function of the new goal file
   alone (`reconciliation:336–340`).
2. **R4 reborn if omitted.** Extra-entry detection reports and does not
   remove, so a comprehensive domain with no projected tombstone has a
   removal with no actuated path (`reconciliation:347–355`).
3. **Briefing honesty.** The distinction between "stops being managed; the
   thing REMAINS" and "will be stopped and unloaded"
   (`reconciliation:343–345`) is a lie if the mutation engine cannot see the
   tombstone.
4. **3-0 on the mapping**, reached on those grounds rather than on any reading
   of R21.

What the refutation removes is only the claim that R21 *already said* P-3. The
decided mapping does not move, and the tripwire is cleaner for having the
sketch retired rather than reinterpreted.

## 4. P-4 — Secrets project as names, and `@{` is now a load-breaking negative

**Decision: `env` values are copied verbatim as secretspec key names. The
projector never resolves a secret, and emits no `@{…}` or `$(…)` sequence.**

3-0, and the schema already forbids anything else:
`common.schema.json:174,178` constrain both key and value to
`^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*$`, which cannot spell a secret value or an `@{…}` reference.
The projector is a pure function of a goal file that contains no secret
values, and it has no resolver and no call site for one.

The audit escalates this from a style rule to a hard one. Per E-5, a single
`@{` anywhere in `vars` fails the **entire** CMDB load — not that key, the
whole file. Guide §16.A's illustrative `"@{secrets.LITELLM_MASTER_KEY}"`
would therefore not merely leak-by-convention if copied, it would silently
disable every projected variable on the host. §16.A is already labelled
ILLUSTRATIVE and already warns it does not load; that warning is now known to
be an understatement, and N-4 below makes it executable.

## 5. P-5 — Interlocks project, whole

**Decision: `supervision.entries.interlock` projects into `tendcf_interlock`
with the entry body copied whole, including `blocks`, `report`,
`defines_class` and the full `pre_action`.**

3-0 on substance. The ceremony argument is decisive and belongs in the record:
baking an interlock's argv into a `.cf` file would turn "the Caddyfile moved"
into a change to the policy-tree digest — a privileged ceremony class — when
it is an ordinary supervision edit. Keeping it in per-host Augments keeps the
change in the class the goal-file diff already reviews.

No field is dropped on the grounds that "the bundle knows" it; a hidden
default is the two-spellings defect. Interlocks are present-only in v1 — there
is no interlock tombstone (`reconciliation:358–360`) — so P-3 does not apply
to this container.

## 6. P-6 — Determinism

**Decision:**

1. Output is `rfc8785.dumps(...)` — JCS, RFC 8785 — and the **bytes are the
   contract**. Not `json.dumps(sort_keys=True)`.
2. No trailing newline, matching `examples/goal-file.json`'s §13 exemption.
3. `vars` is **always present**, even if every container is empty.
4. A kind container with no entries is **omitted entirely**. Omission is the
   goal file's own spelling of "none"; an empty object would be a second one.
5. Entry bodies are copied without reordering, reformatting, or renumbering;
   JCS supplies the ordering.
6. The goal file admits no floats at all (`grep '"number"' schema/*.json` is
   empty; the only numerics are `expect_exit` and `timeout_seconds`, both
   `integer`), so E-8's float-to-string laundering cannot arise from a
   conforming input — and a non-conforming one must be refused, not
   normalised (N-3).
7. Duplicate entry ids across projecting kinds are **refused**, not
   last-wins. Last-wins would be a silent interpreter.

`project()` is a pure function of the goal-file bytes: no clock, no
environment, no filesystem read, no subprocess.

## 7. P-7 — The negative suite

§13 already adopted "a projection with any top-level key other than `vars` is
a negative". That is the floor, per F-9b, not the ceiling. Adopted additions,
each grounded in a measured 3.27.1 behaviour rather than a style preference:

| # | The projector must refuse / the suite must catch | Grounded in |
|---|---|---|
| N-1 | Output structure that changes when only an entry's `state` flips `present`↔`absent` (the R21 tripwire, made mechanical) | R21 + P-3 |
| N-2 | A top-level `variables` or `classes` key — legal to CFEngine, so `vars`-only checking by envelope shape misses it, and `variables` silently overwrites `vars` | E-6, E-7 |
| N-3 | Any `$(`, `${`, `@{`, `@(` anywhere in the output — one occurrence kills the whole load | E-5 |
| N-4 | A resolved secret **value** in `env`, or an `@{secrets.…}` reference | P-4, E-5 |
| N-5 | Any `device-trust` content reaching `vars` | P-1 |
| N-6 | A projection that is not `rfc8785.dumps` of itself — pretty-printed, trailing newline, or non-NFC | P-6.1 |
| N-7 | A float anywhere in the output | E-8, P-6.6 |
| N-8 | Output exceeding 5 MiB | E-9 |
| N-9 | An entry id canonified, truncated, or otherwise rewritten | P-2 |
| N-10 | Duplicate entry id across projecting kinds | P-6.7 |
| N-11 | Non-determinism: two runs over identical bytes differing | P-6 |
| N-12 | A verbatim deep copy of the whole goal file under `vars` — i.e. the rejected P-1 minority shape, which passes a naive `vars`-only check | P-1 |

N-12 is worth keeping even though its position lost: it is the failure mode a
future editor reaches for when the include table feels arbitrary, and it
satisfies every check §13 had before this document.

## 8. The golden

`project(examples/goal-file.json)` is **645 bytes**, checked in as
`examples/host_specific.json`:

```json
{"vars":{"tendcf_interlock":{"caddy-config-valid":{"blocks":"enclosing-bundle","bundle":"caddy","defines_class":"caddy_config_ok","pre_action":{"command":["/opt/homebrew/bin/caddy","validate","--config","/etc/caddy/Caddyfile"],"expect_exit":0,"timeout_seconds":30},"report":true,"state":"present"}},"tendcf_service":{"com.tendcf.caddy.main":{"bundle":"caddy","command":["/opt/homebrew/bin/caddy","run","--config","/etc/caddy/Caddyfile"],"env":{"CADDY_ADMIN_TOKEN":"CADDY_ADMIN_TOKEN"},"run_as":"caddy","state":"present","unit":{"launchd":{"keep_alive":true,"run_at_load":true}},"working_dir":"/"},"com.tendcf.caddy.retired":{"state":"absent"}}}}
```

Note what is visible in it: the retired service is present as a tombstone
(P-3), the admin token appears as a name and not a value (P-4), `keep_alive`
and `expect_exit` are a real boolean and a real integer (P-2/E-4), and no
`device-trust` byte appears (P-1).

## 9. Where the code lives

`bin/projector.py`, beside the two linters, as the **normative reference
implementation**. §13 says "CI invokes the agent's own projector", and
tendcf-agent does not exist; this repo is contract-only. The reference
implementation is what §13's gate runs today and what tendcf-agent must
reproduce byte-for-byte when it exists. It puts nothing Augments-shaped on
the wire, so §9's rejection of a compiler-shipped sibling is not reopened.

This is a **second implementation site**, and that is a real cost carried as
residue: two implementations can drift. It is accepted because the golden is
the shared oracle — drift is exactly what the byte comparison catches, which
is the point of goldens.

*Amended 2026-11-02 (operator; `architecture-DEFINITIVE-v3.md` D45).*
tendcf-agent is Android-only and written in Kotlin. On Linux and macOS
this reference implementation is promoted to `tendcf-validate`, the
command the host runs before cf-agent, so there the gate tests the device
code itself and there is nothing to drift. The second implementation
site is now the Android agent's Kotlin port, and the golden stays the
oracle it must reproduce byte-for-byte; the Python stays normative.

## 10. Register

### Corrections

| id | Correction |
|---|---|
| C-1 | R21's second arrow, `tombstones → the negative-promise lists`, is **withdrawn** as a specification of projector output. The arrow chain is an illustrative sketch (Fable `:393–396`) promoted into decided prose without §16.A's ILLUSTRATIVE stamp, losing the qualifier "the generic bundle iterates" that made the lists projector *input*. Arrows one and three stand; the tripwire in the same sentence stands and is mechanical as N-1; R21's filed register entry (`reconciliation:1233`) carries no arrows and is unaffected. P-3 rests on C-4, R4-reborn and briefing honesty, not on this. |

| C-2 | Numbers and citations from this session that a later audit found wrong. The decisions are unaffected; the measurements were not all re-derived before being asserted, which is the defect. **In this document:** E-2 cited `generic_agent.c:453,573`, the local 3.28.0-111 checkout's lines, for a claim about 3.27.1 — corrected to 447/567. §1 cited `goal-file.schema.json:232` for kinds being "closed and disjoint"; :232 is `trust_domain` (correct for the "read their own configuration ONLY from here" quote elsewhere), and the closed-kinds text is `state_entries` at :54 — corrected. **In commit messages, which are pushed and cannot be amended:** `0d175ef` says 134 findings / 129 byte-identical, measured as 133 / 128; `b12ee79` says "43 §19.x findings" (41 by the audit's count, 33 by a plain `grep -rn '§19\.' docs --include=*.md` — the number is method-dependent and should not have been stated as one figure), says "four of the seven" handoff findings are the dangling Grok 9.12 citation (8 findings, 6 of them that citation, across 4 files — the reference is not spelled with its section glyph here because this is a live document and the target genuinely resolves nowhere, which is the whole reason those handoffs are frozen), says the tool had exited 1 "for weeks" when `bin/xref_lint.py` was first committed 2026-08-15, one day earlier, and says the rejected list-item parser invents 279 section ids (253 on that tree, 264 at HEAD). `b12ee79`'s claim that `--all` output is byte-identical to before holds for the finding lines but not the summary line, which gained wording. The five `<root>` cases, the zero rule-class changes, and the two genuinely-dangling E1 ids the parser would have masked all verified true. Evidence: `docs/paper/reviews/2026-08-16_cursor-grok-4.6_claims-audit.md`. |

| C-3 | §11 of this document listed "`device-trust`'s actual destination" as "**now the next open question**", on the reading that R21's third arrow names a file whose format was unspecified. It was not open. Fable defines "own config" as `device-trust` itself (`goal-file-schema-opinion-fable.md:293`), so the arrow names the region and the file reading makes that sentence circular; the only agent config *file* in the corpus is `:302`'s privileged-promiser-list address, and §7 already ruled that list **empty in v1** because §8 cut the `package` and `file` kinds it needed. The defect is the same one C-1 recorded for arrow two — an illustrative sketch read as decided prose — and arrow three degraded in transcription too ("the **validator's** own config" at `:395` became "the **agent's** own config" at `reconciliation:529`), so C-1's finding now rests on two instances rather than one. Answered by P-8; the §11 bullet is struck rather than deleted, because the error in it is the correction. |

### Residues

| id | Residue |
|---|---|
| R22 | The reference projector in `bin/` is a second implementation site to tendcf-agent's. The golden bytes are the anti-drift oracle. *Amended 2026-11-02 (`architecture-DEFINITIVE-v3.md` D45):* on Linux and macOS `bin/projector.py` is promoted to `tendcf-validate` and is the device implementation; the second site is the Android agent's Kotlin port, held to the same golden bytes in CI. |
| R23 | The kind-token `-`→`_` rule is convention with no mechanical force; hyphens are legal in `vars` keys on 3.27.1 (measured). Do not re-derive a mechanical justification for it. |
| R24 | Device-authored operational state — device nonce, monotonic `approval_seq` high-water, TUF root and high-water mark — has no specified home. It cannot live in the goal file (signed upstream; these are device-authored), it is **not** `device-trust` content, and it must carry no copy of any, or P-8's second-source-of-truth objection applies to it. `architecture-DEFINITIVE-v3.md` open questions 13 and 15, and its §14.4. |

## 11. What this does not decide

- The generic bundle itself. This document fixes the data contract the bundle
  reads; the `.cf` that consumes `tendcf_service` and renders promises from
  `state` is not written here.
- ~~`device-trust`'s actual destination. P-1 removes it from the projection;
  R21's "the agent's own config" names where it goes, and that file's format
  is not specified anywhere yet. **This is now the next open question.**~~
  **Struck: answered in §12 of this document, and it was never open.** The
  bullet is kept
  rather than deleted because the error in it is the correction — see C-3.
- Whether a future kind projects. Decided per kind, at schema-authoring time.

## 12. P-8 — `device-trust` has no destination; it is read where it already is

**Decision: `device-trust` is consumed in place, from the integrity-protected
approved goal file the agent already stores (`architecture-DEFINITIVE-v3.md`
§9.1 — hereafter `architecture §N`, since the citation convention above
reserves a bare `§N` for the 2026-08-15 document). There is no agent
trust-config file, no second format, and nothing for the projector — or
anything else — to write. §11 of this document called this "the next open
question"; §7 had already closed it, under a different heading.**

*Amended 2026-11-02 (`architecture-DEFINITIVE-v3.md` D45):* "the agent
already stores" holds on Android; on Linux and macOS the keeper of the
stored baseline is D45 open item 3 (its §12). P-8 is unchanged:
`device-trust` is read from the approved goal file wherever it is kept.

### 12.1 What R21's third arrow actually names

§11 of this document read `trust entries → the agent's own config` as naming
a *file* whose format nobody had specified. Two things defeat that reading,
and both are recoverable from provenance already in the corpus.

**"Own config" is the region, not a file.** Fable's opinion — the source of
the arrow chain — defines the term a hundred lines above the arrow: "the
validator and agent read their own configuration *only* from `device-trust`"
(`goal-file-schema-opinion-fable.md:293`), which `trust_domain` restates
almost verbatim. On Fable's own definition arrow three is not a route to a
destination; it is the statement that trust entries **are** that
configuration. The file reading makes the sentence circular — the agent would
read its configuration only from `device-trust`, having first copied
`device-trust` somewhere else in order to read it.

**The arrow degraded in transcription twice, not once.** C-1 recorded arrow
two losing "the generic bundle iterates". Arrow three changed reader: Fable
writes "the **validator's** own config" (`:395`), the 2026-08-15 copy writes
"the **agent's** own config" (`reconciliation:529`). Nothing turns on it —
`trust_domain` names both readers — but it is the same parenthetical, re-typed
rather than quoted, losing something each time. C-1's finding that the arrow
chain is an illustrative sketch promoted into decided prose now rests on two
independent instances instead of one.

**The one agent config *file* in the corpus was already ruled empty.** Fable
does name a file, once, and not in the arrow: "a short compiled-in list of
addresses (`package:tendcf-agent`, `package:cfengine`, the agent's own config
path)" (`:302`). That is the **privileged promiser list** — addresses an
ordinary entry must not be permitted to write — and it exists in Fable's draft
because Fable's v1 had gate machinery arriving as `package` and `file`
entries. §7 answered it directly:

> **In v1 the compiled-in promiser list is empty.** Fable's list
> (`package:tendcf-agent`, `package:cfengine`, config paths) existed because
> its v1 had gate machinery arriving as ordinary package/file entries. With
> those kinds cut, the derivation collapses to "any hunk under `device-trust`,
> plus the header" — the shortest this list will ever be. It regrows when
> `package`/`file` land; that regrowth is R1, watched.

§8 cut `package` and `file`, and `state_entries` carries exactly `service`,
`interlock` and `unit-writer` (`goal-file.schema.json:54`). So in v1 **no
goal-file entry can write any path at all**, and the agent's config path has
nothing to be protected from. No v1 file, therefore no v1 format. When `file`
lands the path returns to the promiser list — that is R1, already watched, and
it is a *protection* obligation, not a format one.

### 12.2 Why the file the §11 bullet imagined should not be built

Set the provenance aside; the artifact is wrong on its own terms.

**It is P-1's minority position with a different filename.** §1 of this
document rejected
projecting `device-trust` because it creates "a second read path for precisely
the region `goal-file.schema.json:232` reserves … a second source of truth,
which the corpus treats as a defect independent of whether anyone can write to
it." Nothing in that argument depends on the second read path being
`host_specific.json`. It applies unchanged to `agent-config.json`.

**And it would sever trust content from the only thing that makes it
privileged.** This is the argument §11 of this document flagged as needing F7,
and F7 supplies it. Privilege is **positional** — "any hunk under
`device-trust`", derived by the validator against the baseline's structure,
never from anything in the entry (§7, architecture §9.8). F7 measured how
little the entry carries: of the corpus's four trust bodies, three are recognisable from bytes alone by a digest
(`advisor-key` in the key, `agent` and `policy-tree` in the value), and the
fourth — `trust-policy`'s `{"local_yes_required": true, "state": "present",
"tier": "consented"}` — carries no marker whatever. Nothing distinguishes it
from a legal service body without the schema, which a bare file does not
carry.

Position is therefore not one signal among several. It is the whole signal.
Trust content moved into a standalone file loses, in one step:

- the domain that names it privileged,
- the closed kind set that makes that naming unforgeable,
- the diff, ceremony class and approval record that gate changes to it.

All four would have to be rebuilt for the new file. That is not specifying a
format; it is standing up a second gate for content already inside the first
one.

**The other half of the enforcement is now measured rather than asserted.** §7
holds that "trust content misfiled elsewhere is inert, not covert", resting on
`trust_domain`'s claim that the trust kinds are "structurally inexpressible
outside this domain". That claim was prose and was tested nowhere. `1064def`
adds a `schema_lint` property that smuggles every trust kind and every trust
body into an ordinary domain and requires each to be refused — 9 of 9 today,
and it extends itself to a fifth trust kind that does not exist yet, which
fixtures would not.

It is verified by **M22**, chosen because M21 proved nothing: relaxing
`state_entries`' `additionalProperties` to `true` is already caught by case
`14-unknown-kind`. M22 is the realistic regression instead — a future editor
adds `trust-policy` to the closed kind set, leaving the set closed and case 14
firing exactly as before. At `1064def~1` that leaves schema-lint **fully
green**, with a trust kind spellable in an ordinary domain and the gate
reporting OK; at `1064def` it produces exactly one finding.

### 12.3 What is genuinely unspecified, and is not this

Two things sit beside the question the §11 bullet asked and are not
answered by it.
Naming them is why the §11 bullet is struck rather than deleted.

1. **Device-authored operational state** — the device nonce, the monotonic
   `approval_seq` high-water, the TUF root and high-water mark (architecture
   §9.1, §9.11).
   This cannot live in the goal file: the goal file is signed upstream and
   these are authored by the device. It is not trust *policy*, and it must
   carry no copy of anything under `device-trust`, or it becomes the second
   source of truth this section rejects. Carried as R24.
2. **The bootstrap seam.** `baseline_sha256` is "absent only at first
   adoption" (architecture §9.1), so the first approval record has no baseline
   — and hence
   no `device-trust` — to be verified against. Which advisor key admits the
   first record is a first-run-ceremony question (D41), which explicitly
   refuses TOFU for `consented` devices. P-8 closes steady state; first run is
   architecture open question 15's ("whether a device-local trust root the
   release path cannot write is buildable across macOS, Linux, and Android by
   one person"), and stays there.

Neither is a trust-config format. Both are device-local state whose absence is
already carried elsewhere, and conflating them with P-8 is what made the §11
bullet look open.
