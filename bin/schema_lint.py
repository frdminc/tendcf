"""Lint the tendcf Site Model and goal-file contracts.

Six layers, cheapest first:

  1. every schema/*.schema.json is itself a valid JSON Schema 2020-12;
  2. every schema is paired with an example and every example with a
     schema, derived from the filesystem — a new schema with no fixture
     is a finding, not a convention someone has to remember. Examples are
     bilingual: `.yml` for the Site Model, `.json` for the goal-file
     family, whose canonical form IS JSON (reconciliation §13);
  3. every goal-file-family `.json` fixture is canonical bytes — parsed
     with duplicate keys refused, every string NFC, and byte-identical to
     its own JCS (RFC 8785) re-serialization. This layer runs on bytes,
     before the parse, because a canonicalization violation is invisible
     after one: `json.loads` last-wins on duplicate keys and turns `15.0`
     into a number that reads as `15` (reconciliation §2.1, §13);
  4. every happy-path examples/*.{yml,json} instance validates against its
     schema;
  5. cross-file rules JSON Schema cannot express on its own — domain and
     bundle references resolve, service names are unique, launchd labels
     fall under a declared writer prefix, no writer prefix nests inside
     another; on the goal-file side, every interlock's bundle is used by
     at least one service, comprehensive-domain services fall under a
     `cfengine`-writer unit-writer prefix, and goal-file.schema.json
     itself never `$ref`s a def whose defaults would reintroduce
     ignore-unknown (reconciliation §13, Grok 8.6). Across the goal-file
     family: the diff's two hashes name the two goal-file fixtures,
     applying its hunks to the baseline reproduces the proposed file byte
     for byte, and the approval record's asserted ceremony class equals
     the one the validator derives (§11);
  6. each of the sixty-three deliberately broken fixtures in examples/broken/
     and the six byte-class fixtures in examples/broken-bytes/ is caught
     BY THE LAYER IT NAMES. A lint that only accepts good input is not a
     check; a negative harness that accepts any objection at all is barely
     one, because a fixture that rewrites a file another layer reads makes
     that layer object by construction. Each case declares its rule class
     in examples/broken/README.md's "Caught by" column, read back at run
     time, and passes only if that class fired (reconciliation §13).

Layers 3 and 5 are the point. Layers 1-2 and 4 catch a broken or unpaired
schema; 3 and 5 are what keep a parses-fine-but-wrong document out of a
render (map §0 rule 6: prefer machine-checkable to conventional). Layer 6
is why we believe them.

What this does NOT yet do: projector goldens (reconciliation §13 —
`project(goal-file.json)` byte-equal to a checked-in `host_specific.json`,
and a projection carrying any top-level key but `vars` as a negative).
That layer needs an actual projector implementation, which does not exist
yet; it is the one part of §18 item 5 still open.

Exit 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 cannot read/parse.

    `const` rule no longer touches and nothing would notice. It is the more
    specific half of the claim and was the unchecked one.

    Checked as *supported*, not as exhaustive: a cell naming one of several
    true causes passes, because on a failing `oneOf` every branch failed and
    picking the readable branch is the point. A cell naming something the
    validator never objected with does not pass.

    The limit that buys, measured rather than guessed: on case 24, swapping
    ``schema (`abs_path` pattern)`` for ``schema (`absent` pattern)`` stays
    green, because the service entry is a `oneOf` over present/absent and the
