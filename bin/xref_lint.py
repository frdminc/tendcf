"""Lint the cross-references in tendcf's prose corpus.

This corpus is pointer-dense — the guide, the implementer map, the paper,
the adjudications and GLOSSARY.md all navigate by `§N` and by relative
link — and nothing has ever checked that those pointers land.

Two layers, cheapest first:

  1. every relative markdown link resolves to a file that exists;
  2. every `§N` reference resolves to a section that exists — in the
     document that makes it, or, when the reference is qualified
     ("guide §4", "E1 §5.6", "map §13"), in the document it names.

WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, stated up front so nobody trusts it further than it
goes: it catches *dangling* references, not *mis-aimed* ones. A `§14`
that should have been `§7` resolves fine and passes silently — both
sections exist. That class is only caught by reading the target, and it
is the class that has actually bitten this repo. This lint is a floor,
not a substitute for checking what you cite.

Sections are identified the way the corpus writes them, which is four
ways:

  - `## 7. Title`            -> 7
  - `### 9.2 Title`          -> 9.2      (already dotted, taken as-is)
  - `### A. Title` under 16  -> 16.A     (composed with its parent)
  - `**8.8 Title**`          -> 8.8      (the paper's open questions are
                                          bold pseudo-headings, not ATX)

A fifth notation is deliberately NOT modelled: the guide's §19 open
questions are an ordered markdown list, and the 2026-08-15 reviews cite
them as `§19.8`. Those references are correct — item 8 exists — but the
linter reports them as dangling. Teaching it to read `8. **Question?**`
as §19.8 was tried and measured: applied corpus-wide it invents 279 ids
and silently resolves `E1 §1.4` and `§6.6`, which are genuinely dangling.
The false positive is cheaper than the false negative, so it stays. Every
instance today is in a frozen document (see FROZEN below); if a live
document ever cites `guide §19.N`, that finding is this gap, not a defect.

Exit 1 on any finding. No dependencies: this must run in a bare checkout.

# Documents the default run does not lint, each paired with the policy that
# freezes it. This is a SCOPE rule, not a suppression list.
#
# The reason is that these documents are not allowed to change. A dangling
# `§19.8` in a dated review is an accurate record of what that reviewer
# wrote on that day; a dangling `§9.12` in a handoff is that session
# correctly reporting the defect it went on to fix. Editing either one to
# satisfy a linter would falsify a historical record, so the finding can
# never be actioned — and a finding nobody may act on is noise that buries
# the ones somebody must. The linter's subject is the LIVE corpus.
#
# Two properties keep this from being a way to hide work:
#
#   - Frozen documents are skipped as *sources* of references, never as
#     *targets*. They stay in the section index, because live documents
#     cite `E1 §5.6` and `Grok §9.2` and those must still resolve.
#   - `--all` lints them anyway. Nothing here becomes unmeasurable.
#
# The README.md inside each archival directory is NOT frozen. It is the
# live index describing the archive, edited whenever the corpus moves, and
# its links are the ones most likely to rot. Those stay in scope.
