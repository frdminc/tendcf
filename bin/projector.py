r"""Project a goal file into `host_specific.json` — the reference projector.

The mapping this implements was decided in
`docs/architecture/projector-reconciliation-2026-08-16.md`, whose P-1..P-7
are the specification and whose §8 golden is the oracle. Nothing here is a
design decision; where a choice looks arbitrary the reason is in that
document, cited by clause.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. The projector runs device-side, inside
tendcf-agent, after approval — and tendcf-agent does not exist. This repo is
contract-only, so §13's "CI invokes the agent's own projector" has nothing to
invoke. This is the normative implementation that gate runs today and that
tendcf-agent must reproduce byte-for-byte when it is written (R22). That
makes this a second implementation site, which is a real cost carried
knowingly: two implementations can drift. `examples/host_specific.json` is
the shared oracle, and drift is exactly what a byte comparison catches.

WHAT PROJECTS, AND WHY SO LITTLE. `supervision`'s `service` and `interlock`
entries, and nothing else — not `device-trust`, not `unit-writer`, not
`coverage`, not `host`, not `schema_version` (P-1). The filter is structural:
it keys on domain class and kind, positions whose vocabularies are closed and
disjoint in `goal-file.schema.json`, never on an entry's values. That
distinction is R21's tripwire, and N-1 makes it mechanical.

The exclusion of `device-trust` is not tidiness. On CFEngine 3.27.1 every
projected byte lands at `data:variables.<key>` (E-1), readable by every
bundle and dumped by `cf-promises --show-vars`; projecting the trust domain
would publish the advisor public key, the consent tier, the agent binary pin
and the policy-tree digest into the mutation engine's readable namespace,
creating a second read path for the one region
`goal-file.schema.json:232` reserves to the validator and agent.

WHY CONTAINERS AND NOT FLAT KEYS. Measurement, not taste (P-2). A dotted flat
key is parsed as a scope path — `com.tendcf.caddy.main` would install as
scope `com` (E-3) — and entry ids are reverse-DNS by construction, so this is
every service rather than a corner case. Booleans and integers also survive
typed only inside a container (E-4); flat, `keep_alive: true` and
`expect_exit: 0` would silently stringify. Ids are copied verbatim, never
canonified: the id is the promiser and the launchd label, and rewriting it
would be a second spelling of identity.

WHY TOMBSTONES STAY PUT. An entry with `state: "absent"` sits in its kind
container like any other entry, with its `state` copied (P-3, C-1). There
is no parallel absent-list and nothing is dropped for being absent: dropping
it would mean "stop managing" where the goal file says "converge to absent",
which in a comprehensive domain leaves a removal with no actuated path. The
`.cf` policy renders the negative promise from `state` at evaluation time;
the projector does not branch on it.

WHY THE BYTES ARE THE CONTRACT. Output is `rfc8785.dumps` — JCS, RFC 8785 —
with no trailing newline (P-6.1, P-6.2), matching `examples/goal-file.json`'s
§13 exemption from the newline-at-EOF convention. `json.dumps(sort_keys=True)`
is not a substitute: it agrees on member order and on nothing else. `project()`
is a pure function of the goal-file document — no clock, no environment, no
filesystem, no subprocess — so two runs over identical input are identical
bytes (N-11), which is the only reason a golden can be an oracle.

`validate_projection()` is the other half, and it is deliberately NOT a
checker for what this projector produces. It takes arbitrary projection bytes
and enforces the reconciliation's N-series against them, which is what makes
those negatives testable by hand-written bad projections that no projector
would ever emit. `project()` runs it over its own output before returning, so
a mapping bug becomes a refusal rather than a file on a device.

Two limits of that checker, stated here rather than discovered later:

  - N-5 is enforced as "no container but the two, and nothing spelled like a
    digest in either key or value position". Measured against the corpus's own
    five device-trust bodies, that catches three: `advisor-key` (digest in the
    key), `agent` and `policy-tree` (digest in the value). It does NOT catch
    `trust-policy`, whose body is `{"local_yes_required": true, "state":
    "present", "tier": "consented"}` — no digest anywhere, and nothing in
    those bytes distinguishes it from a legal service body without the schema,
    which a projection does not carry — nor `supervisor`, whose body
    `{"name": "launchd", "state": "present"}` carries no digest either. Three
    of five, stated as a number
    because the earlier wording said only "trust in a value is not caught" and
    that understated it to one of four (F7).
  - N-9 is enforced by id shape, and shape only catches what no goal file
    could spell. Interlock ids are kebab, so canonification (`_`) is visible;
    the service-id pattern admits `_`, so a canonified service id is NOT
    visible in projection bytes alone. The lint closes that half by checking
    the corpus goal file's ids round-trip through `project()`.

The id patterns below restate `goal-file.schema.json`'s, which is a second
spelling and is accepted as one: a projection carries no schema and no goal
file, and an on-device checker will not have either. The restatement is
narrow (two patterns and two lengths) and drift in it can only make the
checker weaker than the schema, never stricter than the goal file it came
from. That weakness was real and not hypothetical: the patterns were first
written with `$`, which in Python also matches before a trailing newline
while JSON Schema's ECMA-262 `$` does not, so an id ending in `\n` passed
(F5). Fixed to `\Z` and fixtured three times over, once per pattern, since
a revert of any one of them alone is otherwise invisible.
